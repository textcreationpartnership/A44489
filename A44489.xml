            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The enſuing Treatiſe was firſt in its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance the matter of ſome of my more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Exerciſes ſome years ſince; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing copied out upon the deſire of one (who I wiſh may be as diligent to peruſe and make good uſe of it, as I was for his helpfulneſs ready to copy it) and afterward viewed by ſome of my friends, met with ſo good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, as induced me to make it publick, that others alſo might have benefit by it. To which I was the rather willing, becauſe it propoſes and excites to ſuch exerciſe as is good and needful at all times, for all that
<pb facs="tcp:102366:3"/>
think of Heaven, and deſire the enjoyment of God and Chriſt; and being in the way thereto, would not fail thereof through the temptations befalling them in the world. But eſpecially in evil and perillous times, wherein ſuch temptations moſt abound. What is there more behoveful for us then, or can afford like ſafety and ſatisfying to us, as Gods love towards us? and therefore what ſhould be ſo much endeavoured after by us as to obtain that, and having obtained it, ſecure it to our ſelves? Indeed there is a general and univerſal love of God (herein alſo mentioned) in and through the gift of Chriſt the Son of God, to be the Saviour of the world, extended to all men, wherewith God prevents all our endeavours, and under which all men are, during the day of his grace and patience, and which men need not <hi>(in a ſort)</hi> endeavour for; it being atteſted in the Scripture abſolutely for and towards all, without propoſing any condition for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it; expreſſed in ſuch ſayings as theſe, that <hi>God ſent his Son the Saviour of the world: Gave him to be the Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for our ſins: That Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners: Dyed for all, and is riſen again: Bare our ſins in his own body on the tree: That God hath
<pb facs="tcp:102366:3"/>
made him Lord of all, and prepared a feaſt in him for all people,</hi> Iſa. <hi>25.6.</hi> and the like. Theſe have no condition propoſed for our being included in them; for its never ſaid, God ſent him for us, or Chriſt dyed for us, <hi>if</hi> we believe or repent; nor is it ſaid, he came to ſave ſinners, <hi>if</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and repent: But without that <hi>if, It is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners,:</hi> That he <hi>dyed</hi> for us, <hi>while yet without ſtrength, ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſinners;</hi> not ſuſpending it upon our believing and repenting: As if in caſe we believe not, he dyed not for us, or came not to ſave us. For though it is true, that there is a ſalvation (and that the main end of his coming) that we cannot have, except we repent and believe; yet the end of his coming, is not to be confounded with the event and effect. He came to ſave Iſrael out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and to bring them into <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> generally, yet many of them periſhed by the way, <hi>Exod. 6.8.</hi> with <hi>Numb. 26.64.</hi> and were not eventually brought in thither. So Chriſt came to call ſinners (not if they will repent, but) to repentance, or that they might repent: That was the end of his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and calling, not the condition of
<pb facs="tcp:102366:4"/>
it; and ſuch an end, as is oft not anſwered in the event, witneſs <hi>Prov. 1.23, 24. Iſa. 50.2.</hi> &amp; <hi>66.4.</hi> where he complains, that when he called, they refuſed, and anſwered not. Beſides, that there are acts of his ſaving, in which he hath ſaved, and doth ſave us, before we can be capable of coming to him for ſalvation, or of repenting and believing. The very foundation of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Faith towards God, lies in thoſe principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt, or Word of his beginning, in which he is aſſerted to have died for all, and to be riſen again: Which had he not firſt done for us, ſo as to have ranſomed us from under the firſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and from the power and juriſdiction of Satan as he would, otherwiſe, have exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed the power of death over us, had he not in that reſpect deſtroyed him, and made peace for us; yea, and did he not ſave us by upholding and preſerving us, and prevent us with his calls and grace, bringing ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to us, we could be in no capacity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting, believing, and being further ſaved by him. In ſuch ſenſe he <hi>hath</hi> partly <hi>ſaved us</hi> by his death, before his calling us; <hi>having aboliſhed death, 2 Tim. 1.9, 10.</hi> and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is ſaving us through his mediation, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of his calling us, yea, before
<pb facs="tcp:102366:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
our obeying him, (yea, and whether we obey his call or not, <hi>Rom. 2.4, 5.</hi>) his <hi>long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering being to be accounted ſalvation, 2</hi> Pet. <hi>3.15.</hi> and ſo he <hi>is the Saviour of all men;</hi> and not onely of them that believe, or upon condition of believing. The feaſt is prepared for men, in which is all fulneſs of Grace and Eternal life given us in Chriſt, <hi>1 John 5.11.</hi> whether men come to him for it, and receive him and it, in and with him, and the invitation prevents mens coming to it, and is given, and is to be given, whether men come or not, whether they will heare, or whether they will forbear. It is not ſaid, nor ordered to the ſervants to ſay, Go tell them if they will come, I have prepared my dinner, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but abſolutely, <hi>Go tell them, I have prepared my dinner, my Oxen and fatlings are ſlain, and all things are ready, come to the Wedding:</hi> This is to be, and is by Wiſdom and her Maidens ſaid to the ſimple, and perſons without underſtanding, <hi>Mat. 22.4. Prov. 9.3, 4.</hi> And they who here go with an <hi>If,</hi> or condition in their mouthes as to theſe things, they do not their meſſage rightly, they keep not the wholeſome form of ſound words uſed in the Scriptures; they let not men ſee certainly, that Grace and love of God which is to be ſhewed them, that
<pb facs="tcp:102366:5"/>
it might be as a powerful Argument to beget faith and affection to God and Chriſt in them; and to make them that duly conſider it willing to come; and which if rejected, leaves them without excuſe, and aggravates their ſin, and makes evident the equity of their condemnation with a witneſs. Indeed in Promiſes and Threatnings, which alwaies reſpect the future, there is an <hi>If,</hi> or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion underſtood, where not expreſſed often; as appears <hi>1 Sam. 2.30. Jer. 18.7, 8. Jonas 3.4.</hi> but not in declarations in matters done. Now I ſay, this love and ſalvation ſo generally expreſſed, is not that to be ſought, to be obtained, or that we may be under it, we being all preventingly under it; and too many content themſelves with being under the enjoyments of its ſtreams, in having the patience and bounty of God exerciſed toward them, and in hearing that God hath loved them while ſinners, and Chriſt hath died for them: ſitting down content with this, or ſome more common gifts vouchſafed in, or through ſuch means, as upon the account thereof are afforded; not minding that though thoſe things be true without condition, and ſo ought to be propoſed, yet they were not done without an end, which ought to be purſued. Though its
<pb facs="tcp:102366:5"/>
not ſaid, Chriſt died for all, if they will live to him; yet its ſaid, <hi>He died for all, that they who live, might live to him:</hi> Though its not right to ſay, God is patient towards men, and doth them good if they repent, as if not otherwiſe; yet its right to ſay that he is patient towards them, and do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> them good, that they might repent: It's not handſome to ſay, The Goſpel is ſent to men, if they will believe, yet it is to ſay, It is ſent to men, that they might believe; and in believing be juſtified, ſanctified, waſhed, renewed, and be made new creatures, having on them the Wedding garment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which they may not partake of the feaſt, nor be the Subjects of Gods choice love, in which true bliſs and happineſs are to be enjoyed; nor be made partakers of the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſalvation, in which Chriſt is the <hi>eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Saviour of them that believe, the Author of Eternal ſalvation;</hi> unto which things, as to our being the Subjects enjoying them, there is an <hi>If,</hi> or condition: And therefore, that theſe ends of what Chriſt hath done, and doth, might be obtained by us, it's needful both that the Goſpel be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared clearly and plainly to men, by thoſe who are thereto called; and that where de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, men ſet their hearts to it, to mind it,
<pb facs="tcp:102366:6"/>
that they might <hi>(in another ſort or ſenſe)</hi> find this general love and ſalvation, that is to ſay, as to the knowledge, belief and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of it upon them, it being (as is ſhewed in the Treatiſe) the way by which men are, and may be begotten and brought to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Faith, and the New Birth, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But I am ſenſible that ſome things might have been ſpoken to that I over looked in it; for ſome perhaps by the love of God ſpoken of in the Text, underſtand not that love whereof he is the Subject, and we the Object, Gods love to and of us; but that whereof we are the Subjects, and God the Object, our love to and of God. And indeed upon conſideration, I had thought of inſerting ſome things in that ſenſe alſo. Not becauſe I think I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it amiſs, but becauſe I think that alſo might not have been unprofitably ſpoken to as one ſenſe of the phraſe, though the matter comes much what to the ſame; for the lover of God is the choicely beloved of God, as
<pb facs="tcp:102366:7"/>

            <p>
               <hi>Note 1.</hi> That the real and hearty Believers of the Grace of God, love God for his love believed by them; ſo in <hi>1 John 4.19.

            <p n="1">1. In what is ſaid to the Angel of the Church of <hi>Epheſus;</hi> viz.

            <p>Object. <hi>That the Apoſtle</hi> John <hi>ſaith,</hi> He that is born of God ſinneth not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his ſeed abideth in him, <hi>neither can he ſin, becauſe he is born of God: how then can a lover of God fall therefrom?</hi>

of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who though they were <hi>God's people,</hi> &amp; he had done wonderfully for them, in ſaving <hi>them out of</hi> the land of <hi>Egypt, yet they afterward</hi> not anſwering his ſo great goodneſs with anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fruit in ſome meaſure, but after ſo great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements to believe, yet not believing, were therefore afterward <hi>deſtroyed by him,</hi> ver. 5.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In the <hi>Angels,</hi> who being glorious Spirits, or ſet in a <hi>firſt Principallity,</hi> or ſeat, <hi>left their own</hi> (or proper) <hi>habitation,</hi> and <hi>ſo kept not their firſt eſtate,</hi> abode not in the truth, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted therefrom (as <hi>Peter</hi> hath it) <hi>Caſt down to Hell, and reſerved</hi> by God <hi>in everlaſting chains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der darkneſs, unto the Judgment of the Great Day,</hi> ver. 6.</p>
            <p>To admoniſh and warn all other Angels, (as the Meſſengers and Miniſters of God's Word are ſometimes ſtiled) to take heed to themſelves and to their Doctrine, to continue in the Truth, and not apoſtatize from it as theſe had done: And thirdly, <hi>In</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrha, <hi>and the Cities about them,</hi> who (though great and populous Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet) <hi>giving up themſelves to fornication, and going after ſtrange fleſh, are ſet forth as an example, ſuffering the vengeance of eternal fire,</hi> ver. 7.</p>
            <p>Secondly, After theſe inſtances of God's Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance upon men for abuſes of his goodneſs, and apoſtatizing from, or failing of his grace, he compares thoſe deceivers &amp; ungodly perſons whom he would have theſe Saints contend againſt with thoſe forementioned <hi>Sodomites,</hi> fallen Angels, and <hi>unbelieving Iſraelites,</hi> ver. 8. To the <hi>Sodomites</hi> in in that <hi>they had defiled the fleſh.</hi> To the fallen An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, in that departing from the truth of God they
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102366:23"/>
were become <hi>filthy Dreamers</hi> (inventors of Lies and Falſhoods, and ſpreaders of them, to draw away men from the name and faith of Chriſt (like the falſe Prophets, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.27, 32.) &amp; ſo from ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to his Lordſhip and Government, whoſe Lordſhip and <hi>Dominion they deſpiſed,</hi> as the Angels probably did through their pride as the occaſion and ſpring of their fall: and, to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> as in not believing, ſo in <hi>ſpeaking evil of the Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> God had ſet in his Church, as alſo in the world; as they did againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi> ver. 8.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, He convinceth their evil herein by the contrary carriage and demeanour of <hi>Michael the Archangel, who</hi> (though a glorious and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Angel, yet) <hi>contending with the Devil about the Body of</hi> Moſes, <hi>durſt not bring againſt him,</hi> being alſo a power (though a wicked one) <hi>a ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling accuſation, but, ſaid, the Lord rebuke thee:</hi> in which inſtance whether the Apoſtle allude to that of <hi>Joſhua</hi> the High Prieſt in <hi>Zach.</hi> 3.2. (where ſuch a like paſſage is read, that the <hi>Devil ſtanding at his right hand to reſiſt him the Lord ſaid, the Lord rebuke thee, Sathan, even the Lord that hath choſen</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>rebuke thee,</hi> &amp;c.) or, rather to ſome other paſſage which the Apoſtle might read (as the following Prophecie of <hi>Enoch</hi>) in ſome other Records which till that time were preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved amongſt them, but are now loſt as to our knowledg, may be a Queſtion. It may ſeem the later rather, becauſe it is ſaid, that the diſpute was about the Body of <hi>Moſes,</hi> of which there is no mention in that of <hi>Zachary.</hi> Now to that demeanor and carriage of <hi>Michael</hi> he oppoſeth the carriage
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102366:23"/>
of the falſe Teachers, that he herewarns of: <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi> would not rail upon, or bring railing accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt the Devil. <hi>ver.</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But theſe blaſpheme, or ſpeak evil of thoſe things</hi> (or ſo many things, as) <hi>they know not,</hi> even of ſuch Dignities (or, Glories, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,) as they ſhould reverence, the Powers over them; or elſe the Glorious things of Chriſt which they have not acquaintance with, <hi>&amp; what they know naturally as bruit</hi> (or unreaſonable) <hi>Beaſts,</hi> what they know by their bruitiſh ſenſes or carnal mind, <hi>in thoſe they corrupt themſelves, or are corrupted.</hi> ver. 10.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, He denounces a woe againſt them, and ſhews the reaſon thereof from the wickedneſs and wretchedneſs of their wayes. <hi>Woe unto them, for they have gone in the way of</hi> Cain (envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and perſecuting their better Brethren, more ſound in the Faith and acceptable to God in their ſervices than themſelves,) <hi>and ran greedily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the errour of</hi> Balaam <hi>for reward,</hi> (or, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers render it, as a reward, namely, of their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned wickedneſs in hating their Brethren, and the way of truth,) they have gone aſtray in, (or been powred out in) the errour of <hi>Balaam,</hi> which was the <hi>teaching</hi> Balak <hi>to lay ſtumbling blocks before the children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and ſo</hi> to tempt them <hi>to eat things ſacrificed to Idols, and to commit fornication,</hi> Rev. 2.14. ſo theſe for reward, as <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> did, laid ſtumbling blocks before the right believers and worſhippers of God, leading them by their corrupt Doctrines (or alſo as a recompence thereof being given up thereto, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.26, 27. by their licentious and wanton practiſes) to communicate with the Idolaters of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102366:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the world in their Idolatrous worſhips, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge the fleſh in luſts of uncleanneſs, <hi>and periſhed in the gain-ſayings of</hi> Korah; in ſuch rebellious oppoſitions of the power and Lordſhip of Chriſt, and the Dignities authorized by him as <hi>Korah</hi> practiſed againſt God in <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi> ver. 11. Yea, he yet further deſcribes:</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Their evil Caſe and Way. <hi>Theſe are ſpots</hi> (ſays he) <hi>in your feaſts of Charity when they feaſt with you, feeding themſelves without fear; Clouds they are without water</hi> (that is, ſuch as boaſt themſelves, and make ſhew of being ſome greatly gifted perſons, but they give no profit or refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them they drop their words upon) <hi>carried with winds</hi> (that is, with ſundry and diverſe Spirits and Doctrines, &amp; not guided by the one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and truth of God.) <hi>Trees whoſe fruit withereth,</hi> (or, ſuch as are in the end of the harveſt towards winter corrupting and rotting their fruit, ſuch as yield no ſavoury fruit; yea,) <hi>Trees without fruit,</hi> (without any good fruit in Doctrine and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, they bring in none to God, nor do any real good in their Generation,) <hi>twice dead and pluckt up by the roots,</hi> (as unfit for fruit or profit to the Church of God, as ſuch trees be, being alſo not only dead in <hi>Adam</hi> and in themſelves, as from him, or in him, as all men naturally are or were; but then after ſome life given them in and received of alſo by Chriſt, they have died again, loſt that life &amp; ſap they received from him, and being given up to Sathan for their neglects or contempts of Chriſt, they are pluckt out of him, have no root or ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him, or in the Grace in him, as <hi>ver.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Raging waves of the Seas, foaming out their own
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102366:24"/>
ſhame,</hi> (troubled and troublous boyſterous perſons, acted and made unquiet by their luſts and evil ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits that have influence upon them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they in their boyſterouſneſs and unquietneſs of Spirit, foam out, ſpeak, and vent forth their own ſhame, their evill principles, guilt of conſcience, or vain-gloryings in things that diſcover their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituteneſs of the fear and Grace of God within,) <hi>wandring Stars that ſeem</hi> to have light, and profeſs that they know God and can diſcover him and his truth to others, but are not fixed in Chriſt, and therefore wander into evil and erroneous princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and perhaps go about too from place to place to corrupt others with their deluſions.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For whom is reſerved the blackneſs of darkneſs for ever,</hi> for whom the greateſt rejection from God, &amp; ſaddeſt diſtreſs and miſery in the depths of Hell for ever are reſerved as their due deſerved portion, as being ſinners of the higheſt degree of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, becauſe they deny the Lord that bought them, and corrupt others from the faith of him. <hi>ver.</hi> 13.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, He confirms the Truth of what he had ſaid about the ſadneſs and wretchedneſs of their eſtate by the Prophecie of <hi>Enoch the ſeventh from</hi> Adam, which though we have it not recorded elſewhere in our Bibles, yet was by ſome other Writings in thoſe dayes handed to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And Enoch alſo the ſeventh from</hi> Adam <hi>propheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of theſe, ſaying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thouſands of his Saints, to execute judgment upon all, and to convince all the ungodly of them of all their ungodly deeds, which they have ungodlily committed, and of all the hard ſpeeches which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102366:25"/>
godly Sinners have ſpoken againſt him,</hi> ver. 14, 15. and then:</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Gives a further Character or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of them, to whom he applies that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, and it may ſeem, firſt, with reference to the laſt clauſe of it. <hi>Theſe are murmurers</hi> (namely againſt God and his Servants, like the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of old in their unbelief againſt the Lord, and againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,) complainers,</hi> (the word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, faulters of their deſtiny, lot, or condition, not ſubmitted to, or content with the Providences of God to &amp; about them) and then with reference to the middle clauſe of the ſaid Propheſie, <hi>Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after their own ungodly luſts,</hi> not keeping them to the word and will of God ſet before them in the Goſpel, but as complaining of the purity, ſeverity, or ſimplicity of that they break thoſe bonds, and tranſgreſs thoſe bounds that they might walk after their own imaginations, both as to faith and manners. <hi>v</hi> 1.6. <hi>And their mouths ſpeak great ſwelling words</hi> (as of their parts, worth, attainments) or as in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.18, 19. (the parallel place to this Epiſtle) <hi>They promiſe others liberty;</hi> they talk of being free from and above thoſe rules of faith and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that Chriſt hath preſcribed, and promiſe others freedom and liberty from ſuch tryalls, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, or temptations as they ſee the faithful cleavers to Chriſt exerciſed under, will they but liſten to them: yea, they ſpeak as if they had their heaven and happineſs, Kingdom and glory here, <hi>while yet themſelves</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>are ſervants of corruptions Having mens perſons in admiration for advantage,</hi> or profit-ſake, flattering and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending mens perſons, their greatneſs, parts,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102366:25"/>
or places for ſome gain to themſelves.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, Having thus at large deſcribed them and the evil and wretchedneſs of their way and condition, he fortifies them againſt them, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them in mind that this was no ſtrange matter, nothing but what the Apoſtles of Chriſt had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned them of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But, ye Beloved, call to minde the words which were before ſpoken of the Apoſtles of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, how that they told you, that there ſhould be mockers</hi> (Deceivers) <hi>in the laſt time, walking after their own ungodly luſts,</hi> ver. 17, 18. and then,</p>
            <p>Ninthly, Gives yet a further Character and deſcription of them, and ſhews the fulfilling of thoſe words in theſe perſons, that they might not miſtake them, as to the perſons he warns them of, and that we in after-ages might know them, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Theſe be they that ſeparate themſelves</hi> (di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide themſelves from the company and fellowſhip of the true worſhippers and Confeſſors of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt, as not one in faith with them, or as ſeeking to avoid thoſe ſufferings and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that they were then expoſed to, probably pretending more holineſs, but really caſting off Chriſts government, yoke, and diſcipline in his Church.) <hi>ſenſual</hi> (or led by their carnal under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and imagination, having no higher principle to guid them, and ſo ſavouring of ſuch animal or ſenſual things only) <hi>not having the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> (The Spirit of faith to make them live by faith in the hope and expectation of the coming and Kingdom of Chriſt, which theſe deceivers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, and made a mock of, and ſo of the eternal life that God hath promiſed to thoſe that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102366:26"/>
him, and truſt in him by Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>ver.</hi> 19.</p>
            <p>Now after all theſe things having ſo variouſly and abundantly both deſcribed theſe Deceivers, &amp; admoniſhed the right Believers of them, he comes in theſe 20 and 21 <hi>verſes</hi> to exhort and counſel them to what might be of greateſt concernment to themſelves, and one another in oppoſition to the way and practiſe of thoſe ungodly perſons, and that they might be kept from their infection and the dangerous fruits thereof. <hi>But ye Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, building up your ſelves on your moſt holy faith, praying in the holy Ghoſt, keep your ſelves in the love of God, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt unto eternal life.</hi> ver. 21, 22: wherein we have</p>
            <p>A ſerious and heavenly counſel given to faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and unfeigned believers for their preſervation in the Grace of God, and attainment of eternal life and happineſs and; wherein is</p>
            <p n="1">1. The compellation, term or title wherewith he addreſſes himſelf to theſe to whom he wrote. <hi>Ye Beloved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Diſtinction of them from, and oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them to thoſe ungodly Deceivers before deſcribed. Thoſe ungodly ones were ſuch as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated themſelves, forſook the Aſſemblings of themſelves together, being ſenſual and not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Spirit. <hi>But ye Beloved.</hi> Ye are not of them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The main thing counſelled to, &amp; to be aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at by them, and that is in <hi>verſe</hi> 21. <hi>Keep your ſelves in the love of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The means and courſe to be taken and uſed by them to attain that end, and that is in <hi>ver.</hi> 20. and that is two-fold. 1. <hi>Building up your ſelves
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102366:26"/>
on your moſt holy Faith.</hi> 2. <hi>Praying in the Holy Ghoſt keep,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The manner, poſture, or frame of heart in which they were to do all theſe things, <hi>viz.</hi> in propoſing to themſelves the ultimate end, <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> to have their hearts and minds ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed to, and waiting for the moſt neceſſary means as from Chriſt toward them as to their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining thereof, namely, <hi>the mercy of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> without which nothing of thoſe other great things exhorted and directed too, could be to any purpoſe either done, or attempted by them. <hi>Waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt unto Eternal life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The two former, the Compellation, or Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle given theſe perſons to whom this Epiſtle was writ, and their diſtinction from the ungodly and deceivers before deſcribed and warned of, we ſhall not inſiſt upon much, only we might note from the firſt,</p>
            <p>Obſ. 1. <hi>That ſuch as abide in the Truth of God and walk therein, when others turn from it, abuſe or oppoſe it, are worthy of, and are to be reſpected with more love by thoſe who are over them in the word of the Lord, and miniſter the knowledge of God amongſt men, than ſuch as ſlight and depart therefrom, and ſo they were Beloved of the Apoſtles and Servants of Chriſt, as well as of Chriſt himſelf in their Ages:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, This word <hi>(Beloved)</hi> ſignifies not only pitied, commiſerated, or perſons for whom good is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, for ſo much love may and ſhould be teſtified
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102366:27"/>
to others whilſt there is hope for them that they may be ſaved: as <hi>Paul</hi> teſtified ſuch love to the unbelieving Jews, who <hi>ſtumbled at the ſtumbling ſtone, and ſubmitted not themſelves to the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God,</hi> Rom. 9.33. <hi>and</hi> 10.1, 2, 3. and it is to be teſtified to all that have not ſinned to death, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2. with <hi>John</hi> 5.16. but <hi>(Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)</hi> is, more intimately affected, valued, eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, owned, delighted in, and deſired: as, ſo Chriſt is called God's <hi>Beloved, one in whom his Soul is well-pleaſed,</hi> Iſa. 42.1. with <hi>Matt.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.12.18. and 3.17. <hi>This is my Beloved,</hi> or, <hi>well-beloved Son,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Cant.</hi> And ſo Chriſt is alſo called by the Church his Spouſe, <hi>Her Beloved One,</hi> Cant. 1.13, 14, 16. It is a word implying and ſignifying more indear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of affection towards the perſons ſo ſpoken to and ſtiled: and therefore uſual in the writings of the Apoſtles to Brethren in the faith and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſt: and never to ſtrangers from, or much leſs the enemies to it. By their uſe of which, they ſignified, either</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Brethren, Believers in Chriſt, were dearly cared for, valued, and prized of God and Chriſt, objects of their eſpecial care and affection, and partakers of his Grace and Love, or</p>
            <p n="2">2. That they were eſpecially amongſt men ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for, owned, valued and delightfully affected by them the Apoſtles, and their fellow-labourers: they being therein of the mind of God and Chriſt, to love and affect eſpecially thoſe who with ſpecial care and affection are embraced of Chriſt, and of God in and through him. <hi>All men are to be honoured, but the Brotherhood</hi> in a ſpecial ſenſe to <hi>be beloved,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.17. not only (though
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102366:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſpecially alſo) with a love of Charity, but alſo with a love of <hi>Brotherly kindneſs,</hi> a <hi>love of Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> 1. Pet. 3.9. Hebr. 13. 2 Pet. 1.7. even as Chriſt preferred ſuch before his natural Brethren, Mother, and Siſters, as ſuch only, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.48, 49, 50. So did the Apoſtles and Servants of Chriſt prefer the hearty believers of the Doctrine of Chriſt before all other perſons, and ſo demean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves in word and deed towards them; owning them as their Brethren and belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; carrying themſelves to them as <hi>Fathers</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their children. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.14, 15. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12, 14. yea, as <hi>a Tender Nurſe</hi> or Foſter-Mother to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward her little ones, as, <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.7, 8. <hi>They were gentle towards them as a Nurſe that cheriſheth her children, ſo kindly affectionate to them that they were willing to impart their lives and Souls to them.</hi> And ſo they inſtructed the Elders and Miniſters ordained by them to be eſpecially careful of, and watchful over ſuch. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.4 2, 3. and exhorted them to be <hi>kindly affectioned one to another.</hi> Rom. 12.10. yea, and this from the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between theſe and others. For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſer.</hi> 2. As there is a great difference between hearty believers in Chriſt, and others that believe not, and much more thoſe that are turned aſide and endeavour to corrupt others from the faith of him; ſo the Apoſtles uſed, and others that are the Servants and Miniſters of Chriſt ſhould uſe in their miniſtration to put a great difference between them alſo: for <hi>The righteous is more excellent then his neighbour,</hi> Prov. 12.26. More excellent, both as to his root, which is Chriſt and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102366:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
God in him, in whom he is by faith planted, and ſtands, and grows; and in reſpect of his bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or what iſſues and ſprings up from the faith of Chriſt in his heart, as his thoughts and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates of, and affections to God, his Truth, Wayes, People.</p>
            <p>Though there may be much of the fleſh cleaving to him in theſe, and rendring theſe ſo imperfect, that he hath no cauſe to boaſt of them in the preſence of God, yet in theſe the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, believing perſon is far otherwiſe, and better than his Neighbour that is unrighteous, and hath nothing of the ſap, virtue and Spirit of Chriſt in him. And then in his fruits and uſefulneſs to others in word, and work, and for the glorifying of God to and amongſt them, and ſhewing to them the way of righteouſneſs, which being righteous, he doth alſo practice and exerciſe himſelf to: <hi>His lips feed many, and his tongue is as choice ſilver,</hi> Prov. 10.20, 21. He is <hi>fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed</hi> for others good and helpfulneſs ſo as others are not; and his <hi>eſtate and condition</hi> is far more excellent; <hi>Better a little that he hath, than the great riches of many wicked,</hi> Pſal. 37.16. Yea, he is more <hi>noble and honourable</hi> in his birth and deſcent as righteous, as being <hi>a Son of God,</hi> John 1.12. More rich, as being <hi>an Heir of God, and of the Kingdom that he hath promiſed to them that love him,</hi> Rom. 8.17. James 2.5. He is more <hi>ſafe and ſecure,</hi> as more out of the reach of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as being infolded in the everlaſting Armes of God; and in all reſpects is furniſhed with, and intereſted in far more durable and excellent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments than his Neighbour is, <hi>i. e.</hi> then any

other man that is not righteous, or that is out of the Faith of Chriſt; and therefore much more than the wicked Apoſtates and Deceivers, that are <hi>Trees twice dead and pluckt up by the roots,</hi> as this Apoſtle ſaith, for they are corrupt, and their hearts wicked, and their works and fruits abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and wretched; being fallen from God and his Truth, there is leſs hope of them than of any others; <hi>For better it is never to have known the way of truth, than after the knowledge of it to turn away again from the holy Commandement,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.21. <hi>Their root is rottenneſs, and their bloſſom goeth up as duſt,</hi> becauſe they have <hi>caſt away the Law and Doctrine of the Lord of Hoſts, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed the Word of the Holy One of Iſrael,</hi> Iſai. 5.24. Though they may <hi>profeſs that they know God, yet in deed they deny him, being abominable and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient, and unto every good work reprobates;</hi> bunglers at the beſt, and void of judgment, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.16. Now as there is ſuch difference between them, ſo it is the part and practice of Chriſts Apoſtles and Servants to ſeparate and put diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them in their miniſtration, as <hi>Jude</hi> here doth, <hi>To ſay to the Righteous, It ſhall be well with him, for they ſhall eat the fruit of their doings, and to pronounce wo to the wicked, for he ſhall</hi> (in going on to be ſo) <hi>ſurely dye, the reward of his hands ſhall be given him,</hi> Iſai. 3.10, 11. and ſo to <hi>ſeparate the precious from the vile,</hi> incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging, confirming and ſtrengthening the one in the Lord, and ſo in the way of righteouſneſs, and reproving, diſcouraging and fighting againſt the other in the way of his wickedneſs; that he might be filled with ſhame, and either be turned
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102366:29"/>
from his wicked way, or be weakened and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded however in it, that he may not be able to do hurt to others, and hinder them in the way of righteouſneſs and ſalvation, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 15.19.</p>
            <p>But (as I ſaid before) I ſhall not inlarge fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon theſe things, but proceed to conſider the Councel and Exhortation here given, for the direction and preſervation of Believers. <hi>But ye beloved, building up your ſelves on your moſt holy faith,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In ſpeaking to and conſidering of which I ſhall, God willing, obſerve the order above propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, firſt ſpeak to the main thing directly exhorted to, and then to the means and manner thereto and thereof preſcribed, as God ſhall afford his aſſiſtance and help to me: And ſo I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The matter mainly or directly exhorted to, and ſee what it implyes and ſignifies unto us, that is, <hi>Keep your ſelves in the love of God:</hi> In which is ſignified,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſer.</hi> 3, 4. 1. That unfeigned Believers in Chriſt are in the love of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it greatly behooves them, and it is required of them, that they keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves therein.</p>
            <p>Indeed thoſe words <hi>[In the love of God]</hi> may be ſo conſtrued, as to ſignifie either the way in which we are directed to keep our ſelves, namely, from the error of the wicked, and the dangers and woes attending it, and then the ſenſe might be, Keep your ſelves from thoſe perſons and evils
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102366:29"/>
forementioned, by taking heed to the love of God; or elſe (which I judge the righter, as to the intent of the Apoſtle here) the way, ſtate or condition, in which the Believers at that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent were, this, I ſay, I judge the righter: for the other ſenſe repreſenting thoſe words (in the love of God) as if they ſignified (in mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the love of God) or the like, is included in the words, <hi>Building up your ſelves on your moſt holy faith,</hi> as we may ſee in conſidering that phraſe; and therefore I conceive the Apoſtle would not ſpeak the ſame thing twice in the ſame breath as it were; beſides that, his ſentence ſhould be ſomewhat defective in omitting the word (minding) or the like; whereas in the other ſenſe all things are plain. And the former Obſervation from theſe words evidently appears to be implyed, namely, That <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned Believers are in the love of God;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obſer.</hi> 3.</note> where we ſhall mind,</p>
            <p n="1">1. What is meant by the love of God here, and then,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Shew that, and how, the Believer is in it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By the love of God is ſometime meant and ſignified his loving, merciful, pitiful and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate affection, in which he willeth and deſireth the good of the party loved, and doth that that he ſees needful and conducible thereto; yet ſo as not in the mean while liking or approving or taking into fellowſhip with himſelf the party lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, becauſe of the unfitneſs and incapacity in the preſent condition for it. A Love of pity, commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeration and well-willing, but not of owning and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102366:30"/>
delight; and ſo it is ſaid John 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life,</hi> which is only meant of ſuch a pitying and well-willing love, not of owning and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving love. For it is not ſaid, That God ſo loved the world as that he approved its ſtate and way, or owned it to be his peculiar people, his portion, and the heirs of his Kingdom, or admitted it into fellowſhip with himſelf. No, the world being there plainly perſons not as yet believing in him, or in his Son, but in ſuch a condition as needed his Sons being given to do that for it, and receive that power and fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>neſs thereupon to help it as might render him an object to be believed in by it; were in ſuch a ſinful, wretched, ungodly State as in which it was liable to periſh in its wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs or ſinfulneſs; and therefore God could not as in that ſtate in which he is yet ſaid ſo to love it, as to give his Son, approve of it, or admit it into his preſence to the injoyment of fellowſhip with him, and life therein. And that is evident, for could God as then and in that ſtate have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in, owned and approved of it, and ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it into fellowſhip with himſelf, and had God accordingly ſo have loved it as ſo to do, then was it in no danger of periſhing, much leſs in no ſuch danger as that it needed the coming forth and death and ſacrifice of Chriſt to ſave it therefrom, unleſs we could imagine that God ſent Chriſt only to preſerve the world in his owning, approving love, and not to procure that it might be ſo loved, or have a way to be brought into it which is contrary to the Scripture, which both
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102366:30"/>
tell us that the world was in a ſtate of enmity to God, and therefore not in an approved ſtate; and that Chriſt was ſent forth for its reconciling to him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the World to himſelf,</hi> &amp;c. and every where im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a need for his doing ſo, that it or any man in it might come into ſuch a ſtate by him, as that it might be owned and accepted, which needed not if it was accepted before. For if it was owned of God and approved, notwithſtanding the ſin of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> &amp; that ſinfulneſs which thereby entred upon it &amp; defiled it, then why might it not ſtil have been always accepted and approved whatever it might ſin in, by the power or virtue of that its corrupted ſtate, that its ſinning notwithſtanding: for if the root hindred it not of God's favour to it, why ſhould any fruit ſpringing from that root, and ſo Chriſt's coming had or ſhould have been in vain or needleſs; yea, and all calls to believe in him, and acting of faith toward him; which ſo pulls up all the Goſpel by the roots, and abrogates the Grace of God that it may by no means be endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And therefore it may in no wiſe be underſtood of an approving, owning, and (as ſome are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſpeak) a <hi>tantamount juſtifying love from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> but only (as we ſaid) of a love of pity and well-willing, in which God beholding its wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs by reaſon of its ſins againſt him, and his curſe againſt it, did mercifully deviſe and find out a way to help it; and where through any of it might (if not obſtinately chuſing their own ruine) be actually ſaved and brought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

into priſon, where he yet remains in his crooked conditions and in danger there to periſh; he may out of pity uſe means to ſet him free, and reclaim him to a beter demeanour of himſelf, while yet he cannot like of his preſent either demeanour or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condition, or own and delight in him as ſuch. And as <hi>David</hi> loved <hi>Abſalom</hi> greatly, even while he was in open arms and rebellion againſt him, ſo as that he was not willing he ſhould periſh or be ſlain therein; yea, ſo as he could have found in his heart to have died for him, ſo he might have lived and come to good; when as yet he could not own, approve, or delight in him, or like to have his company in that his condition. Such a love God loves ſinners and ungodly men with, while yet they be ſuch. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. By the love of God is ſometime meant and ſignified his owning, approving, tenderly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp; delightfully favouring or embracing a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or party loved, as when it is ſaid, <hi>The Father loveth the Son, and gave all things to him,</hi> John 3.36. and again, <hi>Therefore my Father loveth me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I lay down my life, that I may take it again,</hi> John 10.17. that is, he owns, approves, and delights in the Son, as in <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.17. <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well-pleaſed,</hi> and as <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.18. <hi>Behold my ſervant whom I have choſen, my beloved in whom my Soul is well-pleaſed,</hi> or as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> hath it, Iſa. 42.1. <hi>in whom my ſoul delighteth.</hi> He ſo loved &amp; loveth Chriſt not only as his eternal word <hi>as brought forth before the mountains and hills rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing always before him, and his dayly delight,</hi> as <hi>Pro.</hi> 8.29.30. but alſo <hi>as man of the ſeed of</hi> Abraham <hi>and</hi> David <hi>after the fleſh,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to him, did his will, and kept his Commandement in laying down his life a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for us, and taking it again, as <hi>John</hi> 15.9 10. with 10.17, 18. that he hath in all caſes ſtood by him, upheld and helped him, owned and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his doings and performances, accepted him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his preſence, given him honour and glory, and taken up his delight and well-pleaſedneſs in him for ever. After that manner loved he not the world, he owned it not nor approves its works, nor takes it into his favour &amp; acceptance, becauſe it and its works are all evil. But with ſuch a love God and Chriſt loved his Diſciples, as in <hi>John</hi> 15.9, 10. <hi>As the Father hath loved me, ſo have I loved you;</hi> (ſo that after ſuch a ſort with ſuch an own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, accepting, approving love) <hi>continue ye in my love:</hi> and John 16.27. <hi>The Father himſelf loveth you, becauſe ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.</hi> Surely, God loved them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they loved Chriſt, but that was with a pitying, well-willing love, deſiring their good, and afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that to them that might conduce to their good, both as to the making them good, and bringing them to be capable ſubjects of his ſpecial good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, while they were yet of the world he loved them, as he loved the world, and with ſuch a manner of loving them; and ſo gave Chriſt for them and to them as an object fit to be believed in by them, that they might believe in him, and be ſaved out of the condition of the world, in which he found them, and in which they lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their believing in him: but now there he ſpeaks of an higher and other manner of love or ſtreaming, forth his love upon them, as perſons in

            <p n="2">
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:102366:32"/>2. Now the hearty believers on Chriſt, and retainers of his Truth, and walkers therein, may be truly ſaid to be in the love of God in both theſe ſenſes, ſignifications or manners of the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the love of God; that is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the love of pity and well wiſhing, and that both</p>
            <p n="1">1. As they were in <hi>Adam,</hi> not only ſtanding and as there owned and approved as his innocent Creatures (for of his loving men there we have nothing here to ſay, the object of his ſo loving men as ſuch being long ſince ceaſed in <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinning) but as fallen, and yet pittied of God, and not left deſtitute of his care of him to help and reſcue him, for ſo they were parts and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the World, or of that lump of mankind fallen in him whom he ſent his Son for, and who ſtood in need of his Sons coming and ſaving of them.

that there through Chriſt was ſent forth for them, and <hi>taſted death for every one,</hi> Heb. 2.9. by which (bearing upon himſelf the ſin of the World therein) he took it away, <hi>John</hi> 1.29. obtained ſuch a releaſe of that judgment that was upon all for <hi>one offence to condemnation,</hi> that there is <hi>juſtification to life, and righteouſneſs in him for all;</hi> Rom. 3.22. and 5.18.

And both he and the Father in him is ready to entertain thereto all that come to him in the ſtrength and vertue of his grace and gracious call preventing them: which is therefore alſo extended to them generally by God and Chriſt in his works about them, or words to them, with his Spirit there through working to convince, reprove, and move them to ſeek after and turn to him, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55.1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8. and 45.22. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.20, 21, 22, 23, 24. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.1, 2. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.1, 5. and 9.1, 6. <hi>John</hi> 6.37.

            <p n="2">
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:102366:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>2. As brought unto Chriſt they are in a further ſenſe in that love too, ſo as other men are not; that is to ſay, they are in the underſtanding, belief and knowledge of that love of God to man; that is, they in ſome meaſure underſtand, believe &amp; know it, yea, have it in their hearts ſo as they are alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten to God and Chriſt thereby, are born of it, and have the foundation, ground or beginning of their faith and hope in God in it; for it is in the diſcovery and perception of that love of God to man, that the heart is overcome and framed to truſt in God, and brought out of it ſelf, and out of its former falſe confidences into Chriſt; not the ſight of ſpecial love to it ſelf above others, but the ſight and knowledge of Gods love to the World. Therefore when our Saviour had preached to <hi>Nicodemus</hi> the neceſſity of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the entring into the Kingdom of God; or ſeeing and injoying it, he did not afterward, for effecting that regeneration in him, tell him of ſome peculiar electing love of God towards him in particular, but of Gods love to the World in general, <hi>John</hi> 3.3, 5, 15, 16. Even as it was not the lifting up the Brazen-Serpent in ſome ſpecial faſhion for this or that particular perſon of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſtung with the fiery Serpents, and their beholding it as in ſome ſuch ſpecial faſhion lifted up for them, by vertue whereof this or that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of them was healed, but by its being lifted up for all of them in general, this or that man beholding it as ſo lifted up as a common Medicine for their healing, received healing by it, and periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not. <hi>And as</hi> Moſes <hi>lifted up that Serpent in the wilderneſs</hi> (the only common Medicine for all that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102366:34"/>
were ſtung,) <hi>ſo muſt the Son of man be lifted up, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> So the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Tit. 3.3, 4. that it was the effect and product of the <hi>love and pity of God our Saviour towards man,</hi> and not as towards themſelves only, or in ſome ſpecial manner, that they were pull'd out of the ſtate of the world &amp; ſaved. While any man <hi>knows</hi> or takes heed to, and minds <hi>the Name,</hi> fame, or <hi>Doctrine of God,</hi> that ſets him forth in his greatneſs, power, love, mercy, faithfulneſs, <hi>&amp;c: he will truſt in him.</hi> That Name known and minded (though it be but one and the ſame in it ſelf, for and to all men as conſidered alike) will beget and frame the hearts of ſuch as know it to truſt in him. It is the ſight, underſtanding, or perception of the General love of and goodneſs of God to all, even to ſinners and enemies, that overcomes any, whiles ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and enemies to turn to God, truſt and hope in him, and in his mercy for their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The ſight and perception of the goodneſs of God to believers, as ſuch may make a man to wiſh himſelf to be ſuch, and more diligently to liſten to what may make him ſuch that he may partake of that choice goodneſs: and it is very uſeful alſo to be propounded in the hearing of others; as our Saviour did propound the bleſſed ſtate of his Diſciples to them in the hearing of the multitude, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.1, 2. with <hi>Luk</hi> 6.20, 21: but it is the ſight, knowledge, or perception of God's graciouſneſs to ſinners, in his (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the account of Chriſt and his ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and mediation) ready and willing to accept
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102366:35"/>
any poor ſinner turning to him, forgiving his ſins (and not retaining his treſpaſſes againſt him to barr him out from his favour) that draws and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades a ſinner and ungodly one to turn unto him, and hope and believe in him, yea, and it is <hi>the fleſh of Chriſt given for the life of the world,</hi> that the believer alſo <hi>feeds on.</hi> Now all men are not in this ſenſe in the General love, goodneſs, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs of God: they do not ſee, perceive, and believe it, much leſs are their hearts taken with it, and living in it, ſucking in vertue and power from it to truſt in God, and to renew them into his image and unto his obedience. But the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are in this ſenſe in it too, in the words and Doctrine of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 8.31, 32. feeding upon it even upon the fleſh of Chriſt given for the life of the world, <hi>John</hi> 6.51.

If ye keep my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments ye ſhall continue in my love, as I have kept my Fathers Commandments, and continue in his love:</hi> which is another thing it inſtructs too, namely,</p>
            <p n="6">6. To abide in Chriſt, and ſo keep our ſelves in the love of God, both in the views and injoyments of it: ſeeing his love is ſo precious, inriching and every way advantageous to the Soul, &amp; ſeeing it is the portion of the believers in and cleavers to Chriſt, it is folly to turn away from believing in and obeying Chriſt, to forfeit God's love and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and a point of greateſt wiſdome to abide in Chriſt, that we may abide alſo in the love of God, yea, and as that was one great engine and trick of the Devil and his meſſengers for drawing men out of Chriſt, or from the ſimplicity of him into ſome corruptions from the faith preached and urged by the true Apoſtles, to inſinuate to them, that they were not in a juſtified eſtate with God, not own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, loved and approved of him, by their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:102366:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in Chriſt, but that to obtain that they muſt be circumciſed and keep the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> or receive ſome Traditions and Commandments of men, worſhipping of Angels, or the like: So it was the great motive and argument uſed by the true Apoſtles with them for preſerving them in Chriſt, and perſwading them to abide in him, namely, that <hi>in him they were compleat;</hi> were juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, loved, known and accepted of God, and had everlaſting life: and that out of him, or in departing adulterouſly from him, in joyning ſome other ground of hope and truſt in him, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived themſelves thereof; as in <hi>Col.</hi> 2.2, 3, 8, 9, 10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.7, 9, 29. <hi>with</hi> 4.6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 30. <hi>and</hi> 5.2, 3, 4. <hi>John</hi> 2.24. <hi>and</hi> 5.11.12, 13. <hi>In Chriſt are bid all the treaſures of wiſdome and knowledge; this I ſay, leaſt any man ſhould beguile you with inticing words.</hi> And, <hi>Let no man ſpoil you with Philoſophy &amp; vain deceit for in Chriſt dwells all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily, and in him ye are compleat. They they that are of the faith are bleſſed with faithful Abraham. They that are baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt,</hi> and are <hi>the Sons of God by faith in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and ſo <hi>heirs according to promiſe, known of God,</hi> &amp;c. But turning aſide to the Law, to be, or ſeek to be juſtified thereby, they are <hi>aboliſhed from Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>fallen from Grace;</hi> that is, from God's favour or favourable acceptation of them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It behoves us therefore to continue in the faith of Chriſt, that we may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in the love of God. Which leads to the next point. Keep your ſelves in the Love of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:102366:49"/>Whence we may note further:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſer.</hi> 4. That it is the buſineſs of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt concernment to believers in Chriſt to keep themſelves and one another in the love of God, I ſay, themſelves and one another, for ſo I look upon the force of the word <hi>[your ſelves]</hi> here; The Apoſtle ſpeaks to them, as a Community, Body, or ſelect Society, whoſe priviledges and concernments are common, and by a common conſent and joynt endeavour to be proſecuted and purſued. Therefore as when any Meſſage is ſent to a Town or Corporation from a Prince or General to look to themſelves, that their enemies break not in upon them; the Meſſage concerns them in common, and it ſuffices not that every man look to his own houſe or perſon, but that with one conſent and joynt counſel and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour they each one ſeek the ſafety of the whole Corporation or Town; ſo it is the caſe here, Believers in Chriſt are as the Body of Chriſt; and as it is in the natural body, <hi>if one member ſuffer, all are grieved,</hi> and if one be in danger, all endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the defence and ſafety of it, and every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in its place endeavours, not only its own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and particular ſafety and welfare, but the ſafety and welfare of the whole body; ſo is it or ought it to be amongſt Believers. Every one is to take care of himſelf, and of the whole body or ſociety, according to his capacity, <hi>Looking dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently leaſt any fail of the grace of God, or any be guilty of an evil heart of unbelief, or be hardened through the deceitfulneſs of ſin,</hi> Heb. 3.12, 13. and 12.15. eſpecially thoſe that are Guides to

the reſt, or are indued with greater underſtanding in the grace of God, or gifts for uſefulneſs to others (as the eyes or hands in the natural body) are concerned to take heed to their brethren of leſs abilities.</p>
            <p>And in ſuch a ſenſe, I ſay, to keep themſelves in the love of God, is the buſineſs of greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to all unfeigned Believers. To that purpoſe we may obſerve, that as it was the great buſineſs, care and endeavour of the Apoſtles to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards or with the World to preach Chriſt and the love of God in him to them, to draw and perſwade them to accept therof, and ſo to believe in Chriſt, that they might be in the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

So with the Churches that had already through the Grace of God believed, and had obtained the mercy and favour of God in Chriſt (as theſe to whom this Apoſtle here wrote) their great buſineſs was, that they might be kept therein by abiding in the faith of Chriſt, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him: to which purpoſe is that of the Apoſtle <hi>Col.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. <hi>&amp;c.

What can be of greater concernment to a man purſued by dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enemies that hunt for his life, when he hath gotten into a ſtrong hold that cannot be taken by any ſtorm or aſſault, and that is every way well provided for, for his preſervation and defence, than to keep himſelf therein, and not by any means to venture out of it, no not upon the fair pretences and flattering perſwaſions of pretended friends; leſt he fall into the hands of his enemies. Such is the believers caſe here, ſeeing in the love and favour of God he is moſt ſafe and happy, but out of that nothing but miſery is to be met with, it ſtands him in hand to keep himſelf well while he is ſo. Keep your ſelves in the Love of God.</p>
            <p>But now in this Obſervation that follows fairly from the words as the main thing here di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly exhorted to by the Apoſtle, there are divers things implied that we ſhall take diſtinct notice of, as to ſay:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That poſſibly believers may go out of, or from the love of God: they may not abide in it. Yea,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:102366:51"/>2. That there is no neceſſity that he muſt do ſo, he may keep himſelf therein: and then,</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is great danger if care be not taken of, and in turning out of it, or from it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That it is expected from him, and in ſome ſenſe lies upon him as his work, to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and each believer his Brother therein.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Point.</hi> 1. That ſuch as do believe may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly go out from the love of God. This will on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very hand be granted, concerning ſuch as are fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, falſe-hearted believers, counterfeit Chriſtians, and hypocrites; if it might be granted, as it may not, that ſuch are in the love of God, in that choice ſenſe of the word <hi>(Love)</hi> here underſtood and meant; but indeed ſuch, as and while ſuch are not, nor can be in his love. He cannot own, juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and approve of ſuch, and therefore to ſay, ſuch may fall from it is to ſpeak abſurdly and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtently with the Truth. They were not ſuch that the Apoſtle here wrote to, but ſuch as were <hi>ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified of God the Father, preſerved in Jeſus Chriſt, and called;</hi> and therefore were wholly of another ſtamp from thoſe hypocrites, falſe pretenders and Deceivers, of whom and of whoſe ways they were warned and admoniſhed; and from all ſuch as men commonly ſay, may fall from the Grace of God, which they muſt be in before they can fall from. Theſe were beloved of God and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and yet to ſuch he writes, to keep themſelves in the love of God; which would have been a needleſs labour for him to have taken in hand, a needleſs exhortation to be given them if they could not but be in it, could not turn aſide from it, or go out of it. It is to be underſtood then of true and right believers, ſuch as God doth own and approve that ſuch may poſſibly go out of, or f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As that God was angry with <hi>Moſes, Aaron,</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam, David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> and other holy men; ſo as that he inflicted great puniſhments upon them, as appears in theſe Scriptures: <hi>Numb.</hi> 120 12<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thou anſweredſt them, O Lord our God, thou waſt a God that forgaveſt them, though thou tookeſt Vengeance on their inventions.</hi> Pſal. 99.7.8. Yea, how often doth the Scripture tell us of God's wrath and anger againſt his people, even his Zion and Iſrael, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.4. <hi>Oh Lord, how long wilt thou be angry againſt the prayer of thy people? thou feedeſt them with the bread of tears, and giveſt them tears to drink in great meaſure,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.5. <hi>Wilt thou draw out thine anger for ever, or be angry to all generations?</hi> So <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.1. <hi>I am the man that have ſeen affliction by the rod of his anger,</hi> &amp;c. Yea, the Fathers in the Wilderneſs whom God highly favoured, and brought in love and

mercy out of <hi>Egpyt,</hi> &amp; were highly priviledged by him, yet how did they provoke him to diſpleaſure by their unbelief and murmurings, ſo as they moſt of them were deſtroyed in his judgments, and their carkaſes fell in the wilderneſs, and they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded as admonitions and warnings to us, even to ſuch as were <hi>juſtified, ſanctified, and waſhed from their ſins in the Name of the Lord Jeſus:</hi> Yea; the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf looked upon their falls, and the disfavour that they procured to themſelves as warnings to him. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.16, 24, 25, 26, 27. <hi>with chap.</hi> 10.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>and</hi> 6.11. and from the conſideration of what befel them, he lays down this general caution. <hi>Wherefore he that thinks he ſtands, take heed leſt he fall.</hi> c. 10.12. And if it were only poſſible for believers in this ſenſe to go or fall out of God's love into his wrath and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, conſidering the dreadfulneſs of his wrath and the ſad conſequents thereof upon the objects of it, that might be a ſufficient motive to move us to take heed to our ſelves, that we ſin not againſt him, but keep our ſelves in his love and favour; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering alſo on the other ſide how ſweet and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous his Love is. But that ſeems not to be all, that believers may poſſibly fall into out of the love of God. Nay, indeed, love in a high ſenſe may conſiſt with anger, ſo far at leaſt as ſtill to own and acknowledge for his the perſon with whom he is angry; yea, and his in near relation too: though there be not an approving of the way and action that cauſeth the anger. As a man may be angry and greatly diſpleaſed with his Son or wife whom yet he doth not diſinherit or cut off. So God is angry with his Children and people often,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:102366:52"/>
yet he owns for his Children and people. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.59, 60, 61, 62. <hi>When God heard this</hi> (the the unfaithfulneſs and Idolatry of his people) <hi>he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Iſrael, ſo that be forſook the Tabernacle of</hi> Shiloh, <hi>the Tent which he placed amongſt men, and delivered his ſtrength into Captivity</hi> (that is the Ark) <hi>and his Glory into the enemies hands. He gave his people over alſo unto the ſword, and was wroth with his inheritance,</hi> &amp;c. they were ſtill his people though given over to the ſword, and his inheritance, though he was wroth with them.</p>
            <p>There is ſomthing worſe than all this yet implied as poſſible, namely, an utter rejection &amp; diſowning, if men be not careful to keep themſelves in his love, as is implied in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33, 13. <hi>When I ſay to a righteous man, thou ſhalt ſurely live,</hi> (note by the way, that God doth not ſay ſo to any ſeemingly, outwardly righteous man onely, that is not ſo indeed; he promiſes not life to the hypocrite or meer moral man, but only to thoſe that are righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in and through Chriſt) <hi>if he</hi> (that righteous man) <hi>truſt to his own righteouſneſs</hi> (to his being righteous) <hi>and commit iniquity, all his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ſhall not be remembred, but for his iniquity which he hath committed, he ſhall ſurely die;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the life promiſed to the righteous is eternal life, and not this tranſitory life only which the wicked may enjoy, and often do as long or longer, and more proſperouſly than the righteous: ſo the death befalling the Apoſtate from his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (which Apoſtacie alſo, its implied, befals men as a fruit of their being lifted up by and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:102366:53"/>
in their righteouſneſs) is an anſwerable Death that is threatned to the wicked, and which he by turning from his wickednes may eſcape, <hi>v.</hi> 14 which is eternal death. And leſt any ſhould ſay, this is but a ſuppoſition, and proves nothing: it is true, if that ſuch a thing be, ſuch a thing will follow; but when is that, or that cannot follow. It might be as rationally replied on the other hand that then it might be ſaid to the next Verſe, <hi>When I ſay to the wicked thou ſhalt ſurely die, if be turn from his evill way he ſhall live,</hi> that, that is but a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition too &amp; ſo proves not that a wicked man may ever repent unto eternal life, which is manifeſtly falſe; and yet the former is as well ſuppoſed as this latter. But beſides, <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, that by the evil adulterous woman (whether literally or figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively alſo taken for the falſe Church, or falſe worldly Spirit that lays in wait to deceive) <hi>many have bin caſt down wounded; yea, many ſtrong men have been ſlain by her.</hi> Whereby <hi>wounded</hi> and <hi>ſlain</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not rationally be underſtood a bodily and literal wounding and ſlaying, but that that is ſpiritual and of the Soul; and what can the ſlaying that mean but a quite bereaving it of ſome ſpiritual life; yea, of ſuch ſpiritual life too, or degree of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life as made ſtrong, and more firm and able therein thoſe that it was in; as if he ſhould ſay, many hath ſhe caſt down into ſadneſs and diſtreſs of minde, or wounded in their Conſciences by tampering with her; yea, many ſtrong in the faith and power of God by liſtning to her inchantments and pleaſing allurements, have been out-right ſlain wholly bereft of ſpiritual life by her, <hi>Prov.</hi>

bondage, again might reach as to the dammage they might ſuſtain thereby; whether only (as ſome conceive) to the incurring ſome diſpleaſure and anger, or elſe to the utter deſtruction of them for ever: the ſecond verſe of <hi>Chapter</hi> 5. with what follows, may ſhew, where the Apoſtle adds: <hi>Behold, I Paul ſay unto you, that if ye be circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing. For I teſtifie again to every man that is circumciſed, that he is a debtor to the whole Law. Chriſt is become of no effect unto you, whoſoever of you are juſtified by the Law, ye are fallen from Grace.</hi> What can be more full and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant, that they might poſſibly be drawn to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, and to ſeek juſtification thereby, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though formerly known of God the Apoſtles fears of them, and earneſtneſs in arguing againſt their yeilding to it, clearly implies that he believed; for who will fear and be ſerious to endeavour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent what he believes cannot poſſibly happen? now that their being ſo led aſide would not only ingage ſome wrath from God without impairing their ſtate of Sonſhip with God, but would whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exclude them from the favour of God and the fruits thereof, is clear, in that he ſays Chriſt would profit them nothing. Surely, if Chriſt did keep them nothwithſtanding their ſuch falls, in the favour of God and from a poſſibility of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling finally, though they might ſuffer great teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of diſpleaſure from God, he ſhould then profit them very much, even as much as ſuch a foundation would profit a houſe which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding its being ſhaken and ſhattered in the thatch and tiles by the winds, ſhould preſerve it from being blown down or overthrown. And who
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102366:54"/>
would ſay that in caſe the foundation ſhould ſuffer the winds to impair the covering of the houſe, it ſhould profit the houſe nothing, though it keep it from falling? Yea, the Apoſtle ſays further, they were or ſhould be, in that caſe feared by him, abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed from Chriſt, as a houſe removed from its foundation, ſo ſhould they be from Chriſt, they ſhould be bound to keep the whole Law for righteouſneſs, as much as if Chriſt had done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all for them; or elſe they muſt periſh, they ſhould have no help, nor benefit as to their Juſtification and Salvation by him, they were fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from Grace, that is, from the favour of God. So that this clearly implies a great deal more dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage by letting go the faith of Chriſt, a worſer loſs of Gods love, than only an incurring his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for a time here; yea, and the ſame is implied in <hi>chap.</hi> 4.11. in his ſaying, <hi>I am afraid of you, leaſt</hi> I <hi>have beſtowed upon you labour in vain:</hi> no cauſe to fear that of any that were the Sons of God, and known of God, if that were true, that being once made Sons they muſt be ever ſo, and could by no means poſſibly be otherwiſe; for ſure what ever diſpleaſure and wrath they might incur by their turning to the Law, yet the Apoſtle ſhould have an abundant fruit of his Miniſtry in them, in that thereby they were notwithſtanding their fall and what wrath might follow upon it, yet in a ſafe ſtate, the Sons of God, and ſure in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their ſtate, of eternal life. Sure that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be in vain the main deſired end of which is obtained and accompliſhed, And that was the main deſire of the Apoſtles for thoſe they preacht
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:102366:55"/>
to, that they might obtain eternal life through Jeſus Chriſt, of which, if they that are once in the favour of God can never poſſibly fail, they muſt have been ſure in the iſſue, whatever for a time might be acted by them, or come upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But it might be ſaid, How can the love of God, wherewith he loves the Believer, then be ſaid to be ſuch as wherewith he loves Chriſt, ſeeing he loves him certainly with an unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, eternal or everlaſting love, even as in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, but this love toward Believers may ceaſe to be toward them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this I ſay, God in Chriſt never fails or ceaſes to love him that believes on him, with an owning approving love, and ſo as to ſtand by and help him; but when any turns out from the faith, he ceaſeth to be a Believer, and if God ſhould ſtill love him in that ſenſe, then he ſhould not love a Believer but a Runnagade and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate from the Faith. Let men then keep the Faith and cleave to Chriſt, and they ſhall be ſure to find Gods love cleaving to them. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence then between Gods loving Chriſt and lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Believer is nothing, except as to priority and degree, which Chriſt is certainly alwayes preferred in, becauſe in all things he hath the preheminence, but there may be difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and other Believers, as to their abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ſubjects of Gods love perſonally conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; that is, there may be difference in their abiding in the Truth. Chriſt was loved of the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:102366:55"/>
Father alwayes, and ever ſhall be, becauſe he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes abode in the Truth, and did the Fathers will, verily, had not Chriſt done ſo, as man, could he or ſhould he have diſobeyed his Fathers will, and not laid down his life. at his appointing, the Father would not, nor could ſo have loved him; for <hi>Theref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>e doth my Father love me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>becauſe I lay down my life that I ſhould take it up again,</hi> John 10.17. which implyes, that his Father had not ſo loved him if he had not ſo done; for that cannot in any good ſenſe be ſaid to be done becauſe of another thing, which had been equally done without that other thing alledged as its cauſe. Let the Believer then abide in his faith in Chriſt, as Chriſt abode in his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Fat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er, and he ſhall abide as ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly in the love of the Father as Chriſt doth. There is no difference in the Fathers love, if there be none in the Believers faith and obedience from Chriſts, as to its point of continuance: To this purpoſe is that of our Saviour himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 15.9, 10. <hi>As the Father hath loved me, ſo have I loved you, continue ye in my love. If ye keep my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements ye ſhall continue in my love, as I have kept my Fathers Commandements and continue in his love.</hi> Where Chriſts continuing in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers love is made the conſequent of his keeping his Fathers Commandements, and upon thoſe terms alſo he aſſures his Diſciples of a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in his love, which is alſo undivided from his Fathers love, the Father loving whomſoever the Son loves, and <hi>è contra;</hi> therefore in 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.24. they are joyntly mentioned, <hi>Let that which ye have heard from the beginning abide in you, and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:102366:56"/>
then ye ſhall continue in the Father and in the Son;</hi> that is, in the love and favour of them both; ſo alſo 2 <hi>John</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>And this truth here implyed and ſuppoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Believer may poſſibly not keep himſelf in the love of God, or poſſibly may go or turn out of it, ſo as to the depriving himſelf thereof, may be looked upon both as one reaſon or ground of the Apoſtles exhorting them to keep themſelves therein, and as one motive to incite and provoke the Believer to care and diligence thereabout; ſo as to make it his buſineſs of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt concernment or importance, were there no poſſibility to fail or deprive himſelf thereof, it were altogether needleſs for any to exhort him to keep himſelf therein, or for him to regard ſuch an exhortation, or do any thing with an eye to ſuch a buſineſs; for what wiſe man will be ſollicitous to avoid what he judges impoſſible to happen? This then is a fundamental ſuppoſe all couched in all ſuch cautions and exhortations, that thoſe that are in the love of God at preſent may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, if they keep not themſelves therein, fall out of it, that is to ſay, true and right Believers, (there being no others in the love of God, in the ſenſe of it before ſpoken to and opened) may, if not watchful, looſe Gods favour towards them. It were a ſenſeleſs thing to think the Apoſtles would counſel or perſwade any to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the love of God, that were never in it, nor are at the preſent in it, and as ſenſeleſs it is to think that they writ to them to keep themſelves in the love of God, who they ſuppoſed cannot fall out of it, only becauſe ſome others fall out of it,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:102366:56"/>
that we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e never in truth in it, as they that hold the contrary Aſſertion are often out upon it to ſay, while they ſeek to evade the force of theſe Scripture intimations. But again this ſaying implyes,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Point</hi> 2. That there is or may be great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of, and in turning out from the love of God: I ſay, danger of and in turning out.</p>
            <p>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. That there is not only poſſibility of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out from the love of God, but alſo great danger of it that ſuch a thing may be. It is not only poſſible, but many do attempt and ſeek to reduce that poſſibility into act in the Believers, many that are potent and ſubtle in their attempts; ſo that unleſs Believers do uſe diligence and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilance in ſtanding upon their guard, and uſing the means of their preſervation which God hath propounded to them, they may be ſoon turned aſide: And then</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is great danger in turning aſide; the danger that a perſon incurrs in turning aſide is wondrous great, or the evils and miſchiefs that attend upon a mans ſo doing are very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous.</p>
            <p>Something we may note as to either of theſe, they being both of them intimately here ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. For</p>
            <p n="1">1. Though there were a poſſibility of looſing the love and favour of God, yet if there were no great danger of it, no great likelihood by any means, there would be the leſs need of admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, or of taking heed to ſuch admonitions,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:102366:57"/>
when afforded. As it is poſſible for a man to poyſon himſelf, or to caſt himſelf down a ſteep place, it is poſſible for any ſober man ſo to do, yet there is no great danger ordinarily of it, and therefore no great need to give ſerious cautions ordinarily to ſuch men againſt it. But when there are perſons that ſet themſelves to poyſon mens meats and drinks, that ſo while men think only to feed themſelves with wholeſome food, they might inſtead of wholeſome meat take down poyſon, then there may be greater need to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh men to take heed what they eat or drink, and for men to be cautelous what they eat or drink, and from whom they receive their meat, becauſe then there is not only poſſibility but danger of it too, it may too too eaſily happen elſe, that they poyſon themſelves, and ſo when of divers meats propounded to them, and lying in their way, divers of them are mixt with poyſon. The like may be ſaid when there are crafty and naughty perſons, that ſet themſelves on work to intoxicate men, and make them drunk at una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, and then to lead them amongſt Rocks and Precipices, whence they may break their necks.</p>
            <p>Now if it appears that there is danger of mens looſing or turning out from the love of God, unleſs they be careful to keep themſelves in it, then it appears more dearly yet to be a principal buſineſs or work that men that are therein ſhould bend themſelves to, to keep themſelves therein, otherwiſe not; they need not ſet themſelves to keep themſelves from thoſe things which are barely poſſible, and of which, though they be
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:102366:57"/>
careleſs, there is no great danger that they ſhould befall them, or come to paſs. I ſay, though they be careleſs, for indeed there is no danger of any Believers looſing or falling from the love of God, if he be diligent and careful to take heed to the means and way of ſafety, provided of God for his preſervation therein. The danger aſſerted is only in caſe of careleſneſs or preſumption, and ſo there is danger.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In reſpect of the many enemies that lye in wait to ſubvert and withdraw us from Chriſt. As,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Satan, who indeavours it what he can, and <hi>Goes about as a roaring Lyon ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi> And although he be a conquered enemy, and Chriſt that is with the Believer is ſtronger to preſerve the Believer from his wiles and aſſaults, than he is to aſſault and hurt, and Chriſt alſo is as well faithful as able, yet his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs is ingaged for the helpfulneſs of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, and for overcoming for him in the diligent uſe of the means, the Believers putting on and exerciſing himſelf in the armour of God, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and afforded, of which if he be careleſs and neglective, and ſlothful in the uſe of means, and ſo grow from ſlothfulneſs to deep ſleep (as <hi>Slothfulneſs doth caſt into a deep ſleep,</hi> Prov. 19.15.) then is not Chriſt in point of faithfulneſs ingaged to ſave him; but as the Apoſtle implies in <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Thence thoſe counſels, to abide in Chriſt, in the ſame Chapter, and elſewhere, to <hi>be ſtrong in the Lord and in the power of his might, to put on the whole armour of God, that ſo they may be able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand in the evil day or day of tryal, and having done all to ſtand,</hi> Epheſ. 6.10, 11, 12, 13. and in 2 Tim. 2.1. <hi>To be ſtrong in the Grace that is in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> as implying, that otherwiſe we have no

Its only in Gods armour, ſtrength and power that we may prevail, and not be overthrown or harmed by them. And indeed the want of ſtrength proceeds from the want of wiſdom, or the inſufficiency in their ſtrength is from the inſufficiency in their own underſtanding; we have no power of our ſelves, becauſe no wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that may give us power, for <hi>it is the wiſe man that is ſtrong, and the man of underſtanding that increaſeth ſtrength,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.5.</p>
            <p>Now this weakneſs in the Believers under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and ſtrength, may be the reaſon why they are often in the Scripture called Children, and little Children, as in <hi>John</hi> 13.33. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2, 1, 18, 28. For as Children, little Children, are weak in both thoſe reſpects, ſo are Believers in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yea, in their attainments from God and Chriſt, if they be relyed on, and he neglected; for though God hath given forth ſuch an heavenly <hi>teſtimony</hi> as is <hi>able to make wiſe the ſimple,</hi> Pſal. 19.7. and hath <hi>given gifts to men, ſome Apoſtles, ſome Evangeliſts, ſome Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that we might not be as Children toſſed to and fro, and carryed about with every blaſt and wind of Doctrine,</hi> Epheſ. 4.11.14. And the Apoſtle would have the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers <hi>not to be children in underſtanding, but men,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.20. Yet the ſame Apoſtle both ſignifies, that in the ſtate of this life, the growth and attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Believers, even the perfecteſt of them here, is as far below the ſtate of abſolute and

            <p>And this conſideration in both branches of it affords a ſecond and third motive to quicken up the believer to diligence in taking heed to the Grace of God, and the inſtructions thereof, and ſo to keep himſelf in the love of God; ſeeing there is not only poſſibility, but ſome danger of falling from it, if he be careleſs therein, by reaſon of his many enemies, his own inability to deliver himſelf from them, and Gods ſeverity againſt the abuſers

            <p>This is evident in that the Apoſtle exhorts them to keep themſelves in the love of God.

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:102366:68"/>
as to the ſame purpoſe is that in 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.24, 25. <hi>Let that therefore which you have heard from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning abide in you. If that which ye have heard from the beginning abide in you, ye ſhall continue in the Father, and in the Son; and this is the promiſe that he hath promiſed, even Eternal life.</hi> So <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhuah</hi> kept in the favour of God all the way through the wilderneſs, and entred into the land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> So <hi>Paul</hi> fought the good fight of faith, kept the faith to the finiſhing of his courſe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. And many other good men have <hi>through faith and patience inherited the promiſes,</hi> Heb. 6.12. have lived and died in the faith, and ſo in the love and favour of God, and are at reſt with Chriſt and God, otherwiſe men ſhould be never the better but the worſe rather for belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and coming to partake of the Grace of God. For, better never to know it at all, than to fall from it after the ſweetneſs of it is once known and taſted. The ſin being then the greater, and the miſery incurred more dreadful and unbeara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2 20, 21, 22.</p>
            <p>But now this poſſibility of being kept in the love of God is not from any ſtrength, wiſdom or faithfulneſs in man, as of himſelf, no more than his being brought into the love of God was by his own fleſhly wiſdom or ſtrength, but both the one and the other are by and of the Grace of God. Its true in both ſenſes (both of ſaving at the firſt from the ſtate of ſin and death into the ſtate of life and righteouſneſs, by being brought into Chriſt, and of ſaving in continuance in the love of God, and being preſerved from falling back again) <hi>By Grace ye are ſaved,</hi> Epheſ. 2.5. and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:102366:69"/>
               <hi>ye are ſaved by Grace through Faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God,</hi> verſe 8. <hi>For in us,</hi> though Believers, <hi>that is, in our fleſh, there dwells no good thing; nor have we ſufficiency in our ſelves, as of our ſelves, to think any thing,</hi> Rom. 7.18. 2 Cor. 3.5. We have before noted the ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in man, even in Believers, as men, and ſo in and of themſelves (yea, or in their inherent gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces received) to ſtand and maintain themſelves againſt the power of their enemies, but only <hi>in the Grace that is in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.1. <hi>In the Lord, and in the power of his might, in the whole armour of God,</hi> as Epheſ. 6.10, 11, 12. But ſuch might power and ſufficiency there is in the Grace of God, afforded in and by Jeſus Chriſt, ſuch ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Chriſt himſelf, and in God in him, and ſuch a preſence and power of God and his holy Spirit, in and with his Doctrine and Goſpel, and ſuch Armour of Righteouſneſs given the Believer in him, as that there through he may be kept in the love and favour of God, maugre all the power, malice and ſubtlety of the enemy, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that great weakneſs and inability to keep himſelf, or to vanquiſh the enemy that is in him ſelf.</p>
            <p>Thus the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> confeſſes that he was not only furniſhed for and ſtrengthned in his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours (I <hi>laboured more abundantly than they all, yet not I but the Grace of God that was with me, and by the Grace of God I am that I am; and his Grace that was beſtowed upon me was not in vain towards me.</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10.) but alſo when tempted and buffeted of Sathan and in danger to be harmed; he crying to Chriſt for help, Chriſt anſwered him
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:102366:69"/>
               <hi>that his Grace was ſufficient for him,</hi> his favour relied upon and looked to, would afford all ſupplies for ſafety and ſatisfaction to him, for therein a man hath God and Chriſt with him and for him in whom there is all things that may preſerve him. As,</p>

thereof to fall before them; ſo Chriſt kept him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the wicked one, that he touched him not by any of his temptations, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. and ſo both he and his Servants have confounded their Adverſaries, and convinced and converted many of them.</p>
            <p>And then laſtly, They have free acceſs to God through Jeſus Chriſt <hi>by Prayer and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> to make known their needs and requeſts to him, either for ſupplyes and help to themſelves and one another, or for rebuking, taking off, or weakening their Adverſaries and Exerciſes.

            <p>This is as the Chriſtians Bullets of Ordnance, that he ſtorms Heaven by, as it were, and takes it by force, and that being ſhot up towards Heaven from a fervent faithful heart, falls down again upon the wicked Adverſaries, and doth great exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution and ſlaughter upon them: ſo we may ſee how <hi>the Prayers of the Saints,</hi> being <hi>offered up by the Angel, who had many ſweet odours</hi> to make them acceptable (<hi>Revel.</hi> 8.3, 4, 5.) procured <hi>fire to be caſt upon the earth, with voyces, thundrings,

lightnings, and a great earthquake,</hi> whereby the judgments of God upon the Adverſaries were implyed and ſignified.</p>
            <p>Now all theſe things being conſidered, it will evidently appear, that it is very poſſible for the Believer to be kept in the love of God, nay, that it is certain he ſhall be ſo if he be not greatly neglective of the means of his ſafety and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, ſo many and ſo effectual for that purpoſe; yea, indeed a man might marvail, theſe things for the Believers defence being well weighed, how it ſhould poſſibly be, that he ſhould fail of the Grace of God, fall out of his love and favour, and periſh from his preſence by any means; but that we have ſeen the poſſibility and danger too thereof before aſſerted, which alſo may further (as to the reaſon of it) be made manifeſt in the next conſideration, wherein it is further noted as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, that he being ſo ſtrongly and well fortified and furniſhed for his ſafe keeping in the love of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Point</hi> 4. It is expected from him, and in ſome ſenſe lyes upon him, as his work, to keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and each Believer to keep his Brother there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
            <p>Though as he did not bring himſelf into Chriſt, and ſo into the love and favour of God by his wiſdom, will, power or goodneſs, but he was <hi>called into</hi> him, and <hi>made in him of God;</hi> ſo neither is it his work in his own power, wiſdom and ſtrength to keep himſelf there, or defend himſelf from what would intice him or force him out:
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:102366:77"/>
Yet as it was his act in and by the Grace of God in Chriſt, to believe and come to Chriſt, and ſo into the love and favour of God: So it is his act alſo, ſubordinately in and by the ſame Grace to keep himſelf in Chriſt, and ſo in the love of God; whence our Saviour ſo often requires it of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples. <hi>Abide in me, and let my words abide in you; &amp; continue ye in my love,</hi> Joh. 15.4.9. <hi>Hold faſt what thou haſt, let no man take away thy Crown,</hi> Rev. 3.11. with which agrees many paſſages of the Apoſtles, to <hi>ſtand faſt, quit themſelves like men; let that they have received, abide; abide in Chriſt,</hi> and the like; as alſo that aſſertion in 1 John 5.18. <hi>He that is born of God keepeth himſelf that the wicked one toucheth him not.</hi> In which keeping a mans ſelf in the love of God is ſignified as to the act of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Believer be and abide in that ſtate and way he is already in through the Grace of God, not departing, voluntarily leaving or going out therefrom, keep himſelf well while he is well, being content with Chriſt, confident and well aſſured of his well doing and happineſs in ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing: to that purpoſe are thoſe phraſes, of <hi>abiding, continuing, not departing</hi> or <hi>withdrawing from the living God,</hi> as in <hi>John</hi> 8.32. and 15.4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.23. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.24, 28. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12. and 10.35, 38, 39. as implying, that no man heartily believing in Chriſt can miſcarry, but through a voluntary neglect of, or departure from him. It is no violence done to him can force him but by his own conſent. The caſe of a Believer, as we ſhewed before, is like the condition of a man, that
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:102366:77"/>
though very weak and unable of himſelf to reſiſt or ſtand againſt the power of his enemies, yet hath a ſtrong Caſtle or Tower, in which he is ſo ſtrongly fortified, and ſo every way unattachable, by either ſtorming, undermining, or ſtarving of him, that there is certain ſafety for him in abiding in it, and no poſſibility for his enemies catching of him, unleſs he voluntarily go out of it. Such is the Believers condition being in Chriſt and God, nothing can come upon him to harm him (none can pluck or take him by force out of it) unleſs he willingly ſin and depart from God and Chriſt after the knowledge of the Truth received; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which departing and drawing back from, and forſaking God, and ſo their <hi>own mercies,</hi> the Spirit of God therefore by his Servants is dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently provoking and exhorting them; as, <hi>Take heed Brethren, leaſt there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God;</hi> and <hi>let us hold faſt the profeſſion of our faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wavering; for he is faithful that hath promiſed, Caſt not away your confidence,</hi> &amp;c, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12. and 10.23, 35.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That becauſe Satan by himſelf and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is crafty, ſubtle and vigilant, to intice, allure and tempt Believers to make a voluntary defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from God and Chriſt, either to avoid the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and troubles in and to the fleſh, that he endeavours to fill them with, and which God, for the tryal of their faith in him, and love and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him, exerciſes him with, or permits and orders to come upon him, or elſe to gain the ſweetneſs and profit of other carnal or worldly

            <p>To this purpoſe are thoſe many counſels, to <hi>Watch and ſtand faſt, quit themſelves like men, and be ſtrong,</hi> 1 Cor. 16.13. <hi>To take heed to themſelves and put on the whole Armour of God,</hi> and therein <hi>to reſiſt Satan,</hi> and <hi>yet</hi> ſtill <hi>to ſtand, to walk circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly, not as fools, but as wiſe, &amp;c.</hi> Unto which things God having in his favour abundandantly furniſhed them, expects and requires their care and diligence, and exerciſe of their powers

That the courage, wiſdom, power, vertues of God appearing in us, no <hi>Momus</hi> or Carper might find any juſt ground of reviling us, as being ſaved of God, but wholly deſtitute of the vertues of God, and unſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, as having nothing but a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs imputed to us, without any power or life of God working in us, or wrought forth by us.

            <p>It is true that it is his work to keep us ſafe but in our hearing and following him and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and ſo in keeping to him; as it's the Caſtle and ſtrong hold that keeps the man that flies to it, but it is in his keeping within it, and not depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of it, becauſe of any aſſaults made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, or flatteries of the enemy that would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice him out of it.

            <p>Indeed all the Scriptures do ſhew ſufficiently the certain attainment of eternal life by thoſe that are careful to wait upon God, and look diligently to him by Jeſus Chriſt for his ſupplying, keeping and ſaving of them: that <hi>wait upon him and keep his way:</hi> that <hi>hear Chriſts voice and follow him,</hi> and do not preſume to turn away from him or ſit looſe from his inſtructions by which they may and ſhould be kept cloſe to him; but though <hi>the juſt

But the Apoſtle plainly implies, that becauſe its God that works in and through the Grace revealed to and received by the believer of good pleaſure, ſo as not bound or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged ſo to work but only of his mercy and good will, therefore it behooves believers to yield up themſelves to and in his operations to will and do and ſo to work out what he is working in them: and not to reſiſt and quench his operations leaſt ſo they ſhould provoke him who is a free agent, and works only of good will, to be offended with them, and withdraw his operations and good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by which he is operating and working in them from them, and then they can do nothing toward

            <p>Let us, if God permit, conſider them in order: And firſt,</p>

            <p n="7">7. How the building up themſelves thereon conduceth to the keeping themſelves in the love of God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the Faith here mentioned, what it is or ſignifies, we are to mind that the word Faith is is uſed two ways; either,</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the act or habit of believing, and ſo it often ſignifies, as in theſe expreſſions, <hi>Lord increaſe our faith: and if ye had faith as a grain of muſtard ſeed, ye ſhould be able to ſay to this Sycamore tree,

be thou plucked up by the roots, and be thou planted into the midſt of the Sea, and it ſhould obey you,</hi> Luke 17.4, 5. <hi>Your faith is ſpoken of throughout the world,</hi> Rom. 1.5. <hi>Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing is of the word of God,</hi> Rom. 10.17. <hi>After I heard of your faith in the Lord Jeſus, and love to all the Saints,</hi> Epheſ. 1.15. and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:102366:86"/>That Doctrine then (or Chriſt himſelf as therein preached, as the Son of God and Saviour of the World, delivered up to death and crucified for our offences, and raiſed again from the dead for our juſtification, and glorified at' Gods right hand for our ſalvation, and that our faith and hope might be in God, and ſo as appointed to be Lord and Chriſt, the Judge of all, who ſhall come again to judge both the quick and the dead) is the faith here meant, whereon Believers are to edifie and build up themſelves, and not their act, acts or habit of believing, which may be added to and builded up, being imperfect, upon this founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo as this foundation cannot upon any thing elſe; yea, that Chriſt, as ſo laid and held forth in the Coſpel, is the foundation to be built on is plain. For</p>
            <p n="1">1. Chriſt was the firſt thing appointed or laid of God for fallen mankind, as to his purpoſe and promiſe of him; and he was the firſt thing prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to him, in order to his return to God: This was the Doctrine firſt preached in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, after our firſt Parents had ſinned, and were convicted thereof: <hi>I will put enmity between thee</hi> (the Serpent) <hi>and the Woman, and between thy ſeed and her ſeed: He</hi> (her Seed) <hi>ſhall bruiſe thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel.</hi> Though Chriſt was not as then actually manifeſted in the fleſh, crucified, dead, buried and raiſed again, yet all that was intimately preached from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as a thing to be accompliſhed in its time and ſeaſon.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:102366:87"/>2. And as this was the firſt thing or Doctrine preached, ſo it was the foundation and ground of all other diſpenſations of God after to fallen man. It is upon that account of Chriſts having inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed between God and us, as the bruiſer of the Serpents head, the deſtroyer of his work, the taker away and aboliſher of Death, that God now deals mercifully and graciouſly with men, is inviting and leading them to repentance by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>is goodneſs and forbearance, and lades them with his benefits, and ſends forth his light and truth to men, to call them back to himſelf and to his Kingdom, to be under his government and protection, from which they were baniſhed for their iniquity; and ſo it is the ground and foundation of his Ordinances, witneſſing of Chriſt, and of himſelf in Chriſt unto men, and appointed as mediums for mens ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to him, and ſeeking of him, and of Gods raiſing up and judging all men according to their works hereafter; for there would have been no reſurrection from the firſt death to any new judgment, much leſs to life, if Chriſt had not come and dyed for all men, and riſen again, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.12, 17, 18. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.42. and 17.30, 31. The final rewards and recompencings of men then, (as alſo his preſent chaſtiſements in mercy and meaſure now) and accepting and juſtifying, ſaving and honouring thoſe that believe in him, and ſerve him, ſtand upon Chriſt, and his death and ſufferings for all men, and riſing again, and being appointed Lord of all, and Mediator of God and men, the propitiation for our ſins, even for the ſins of the whole world, as their proper ground and foundation. Yea,</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:102366:87"/>3. He, as ſo ſet forth, is the ground and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all right repenting and turning to God from our our ſins, and of all right believing, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and truſting in God for his mercy and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, of all prayers and praiſes to be made to God, and ſo of all true piety and religion in fallen men; for had there not been ſuch a Ranſome found out, and Sacrifice offered for us, there could have been no approach for us to God, or acquaintance with God: <hi>God ſent him, that the world through him might be ſaved,</hi> and <hi>raiſed him from the dead, and gave him glory, that our faith and hope might be in God,</hi> John 3.17. 1 Pet. 2.21. So that he, and the Word of the Goſpel as ſetting him forth, is meant by the faith here, on which Believers are built, and to build up themſelves and each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Now this is called their faith, not becauſe it is of them, of their invention, broaching, or preparing, as a foundation for themſelves or others, but becauſe it is owned, received and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by them; it is that that they have and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in their hearts unto righteouſneſs, and with their mouths confeſs to the ſalvation of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſometimes calls the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel he preached, his Goſpel, as in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. <hi>According to my Goſpel:</hi> And ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16. Not becauſe it was of him found out or invented, or ſet on foot by him, as if he had preached any thing for Goſpel that he had not received from God and Chriſt, but becauſe it was miniſtred and preached by him; even ſo this faith after the ſame manner is called the Believers faith, as elſewhere, <hi>The faith of Gods Elect, Tit.</hi> 1.2. becauſe made known
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:102366:88"/>
and delivered to his elected and choſen Servants, ſuch as he choſe to be his Servants (the holy Apoſtles and Prophets) to be declared and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by them, as accordingly it was publiſhed by them, and as it is called, <hi>The faith once delivered to the Saints,</hi> in this Epiſtle of <hi>Jude,</hi> ver. 3. becauſe it was delivered to them, and preached by them, it might be called their faith, though otherwiſe it is the faith of God and Chriſt: Yea, and in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it the faith of theſe believers, the Apoſtle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately diſtinguiſheth it from the falſe ſaiths or falſe doctrines of the falſe Teachers and Seducers, of whom he had been warning them; as if he ſhould ſay, it is not their faith, they have corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves and fallen away from it, and have received, or deviſed, and broached another faith, doctrine or foundation different from, and repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to yours, with which I would have you have nothing to do, much leſs build your ſelves thereon, for that would not render you an houſe or habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for God, and ſo objects of his favour, but Synagogues of Satan, and objects of Gods wrath and anger; but build ye up your ſelves on your faith, which he alſo, the better to induce them thereto, calls their moſt holy faith. Which leads us to the third particular.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Why it is called the moſt holy faith.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is holy, that is, it is pure, faultleſs, no falſhood or corruption in it, for ſo holineſs is ſometimes oppoſed to uncleanneſs or filthineſs: as, <hi>We are not called to uncleanneſs, but unto holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4.7. <hi>Cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſs in
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:102366:88"/>
the fear of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.1. So this Doctrine delivered to the Saints, preached by the holy Apoſtles and Prophets, and witneſſed to by the holy Spirit, and ſo by the holy God, who bare witneſs to the Preachers of it, both with <hi>Signs, and wonders, and divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Heb. 24. is a holy, pure, clean Word; <hi>The Word of the Lord</hi> (as the Goſpel of Jeſus Ghriſt as preached by the Apoſtles, is often called, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 6 2, 7. and 8.25. and 12.24. and 13.5, 7, 12, 44, 46 49.) <hi>is pure as Silver ſeven times tryed in the fire,</hi> Pſal. 12.6. No droſs or mixture in it; it is <hi>not yea</hi> and nay, but yea, yea, or <hi>yea and Amen,</hi> as in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.18, 19. <hi>As God is true our word toward you was not yea and nay, for the Son of God, Jeſus Chriſt, who was preached among you by us, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea, for all the promiſes of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.</hi> The Apoſtles did ſpeak in ſimplicity and ſincerity what they had heard and received from God and Chriſt, and did not, as the falſe Apoſtles, ſophiſticate and <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the Word of God,</hi> as the Apoſtle alſo ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.17. <hi>But as in ſincerity, and as of God they ſpake in Chriſt in the ſight of God.</hi> Even as Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, the matter and ſubject of their word, the faith or foundation of faith, the object to be cloſed with, and reſted or built upon, is the holy One (the holy One of <hi>Iſrael</hi>) and ſo is frequently ſtiled, as <hi>Acts</hi> 3.14. <hi>Ye denyed the holy One and the juſt.</hi> So 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.20. <hi>Ye have an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction from the holy One, and ye know all things:</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26. <hi>He is holy, harmleſs, undefiled,</hi> &amp;c. a ſpotleſs one, <hi>a Lamb without blemiſh;</hi> his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

and life, and death, and ſacrifice, and perſon, altogether blameleſs, ſinleſs, and undefiled; even ſo the Doctrine of the Apoſtles concerning him was pure and clean too, like to <hi>pure water.</hi> No ſoil or mud in it. Yea, and</p>
            <p n="2">2. It was and is ſet apart, ſeparated and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God, and for his glory, to be the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ground and way of our believing, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming an holy habitation and people for God. Jeſus Chriſt, the main matter and ſubject treated of in the Goſpel, is in that ſenſe holy to God, choſen by him, ſeparated and ſet apart for him, to <hi>be his ſalvation to the ends of the earth; the Lamb of God to take away the ſins of the world; his righteous Servant,</hi> in whoſe hand his pleaſure ſhall proſper; <hi>his Elect, in whom his Soul delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;</hi> who hath ſanctified himſelf, and given up himſelf to him to do his will in all things; to be his Prophet to declare his mind, <hi>and bring forth judgment to the Gentiles, and light to the people;</hi> to be his High-Prieſt, as it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord hath ſworn and will not repent, Thou art a Prieſt to me for ever, after the order of</hi> Melchiſedeck, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110, 3, 4. to make atonement for the ſins of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, offer up their gifts and ſacrifices, and make interceſſion for all that come to God by him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17, and 5.1. and 7.25. and bleſs them in his Name, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.6, 7. His <hi>King, whom he hath ſet upon his holy hill of Sion,</hi> Pſal. 2.6, 7. being wholly holy unto God to do his pleaſure in his preſence for men, and from him to and with men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.10. his Foundation, namely, that he hath lay in <hi>Sion,</hi> to be the foundation and corner-ſtone

of his holy building, an habitation for his Holineſs and glory, by vertue of whom it is that the whole building becomes an holy Houſe to God, and an habitation ſeparated unto him to dwell in by his Spirit, as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.20, 21. And ſo the Doctrine or Faith concerning him is holy, ſeparated and ſet apart for Gods uſe, for drawing men into the knowledg and faith of Chriſt, and ſo to himſelf by and through him, and therefore it is called, <hi>The power of God to ſalvation to every one that believes, Rom.</hi> 1.16. The Medium that he made choice of for ſaving thoſe that believe it, and ſo through it believe in him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. ſo that in this reſpect too it is holy. As alſo,</p>
            <p n="3">3. In reſpect of the effect and fruit of it, it makes holy thoſe that receive it, and are united with it, and built upon it: So Jeſus Chriſt, the main matter and ſubject of it, the foundation properly laid in it and by it for men to believe in and be built on, is not only holy in himſelf, ſinleſs and ſet apart for God; but alſo is <hi>made of God holineſs to us,</hi> the cauſe of holineſs to us. He in and by vertue of whom we are holy to God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. He being the holy Temple and habitation of God, makes us ſo too in being united with him. He being the holy foundation makes all the building holy. And ſo the Doctrine of the Apoſtles preached and publiſhed concerning him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and held faſt by theſe Believers, was holy in reſpect of the effect and fruit of it in Believers, who are ſaid to be <hi>ſanctified by the faith in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Acts 26.28. <hi>Sanctified</hi> (or made holy) <hi>through Gods Word, which is the Truth,</hi> John 17.17. and to be <hi>made clean through the Word ſpoken

            <p n="4">4. It is called the holy Faith, to ſignifie the great care that God hath of it, its acceptableneſs to him, and his reſpect to and care of it; as in that ſenſe in <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Iſrael</hi> was ſaid to <hi>be holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Lord,</hi> being his people, his peculiar portion, he had an eſpecial care over them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them, ſo as that <hi>all that devoured them, offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, evil came or ſhall come upon them.</hi> So is Chriſt holineſs to the Lord, very dear and delightful to him, and therefore eſpecially cared for and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by him; as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.21. <hi>With him his right hand is eſtabliſhed, and his arm ſtrengthens him, ſo as the enemy ſhall not exact upon him, nor the ſon of wickedneſs afflict him, he will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him.</hi> Yea, therefore they that believe not in him ſhall be condemned and periſh, and they ſhall be deſtroyed that will not hear and obey him: <hi>Mat.</hi>

And ſo God hath a ſingular watchfulneſs over, and care of his Name and Doctrine; the Goſpel of Chriſt preaching and declaring him as the foundation of God for men, ſo as that he will not bear that it ſhould be ſlighted, rejected and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed by men; <hi>It ſhall be eaſier in the judgment for</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah <hi>than for thoſe that ſo do, Matth.</hi> 10.15. with <hi>John</hi> 12.48, 49 50.

            <p n="3">3. And indeed the main reaſon why the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle calls the faith of theſe Believers the moſt holy faith, was to commend it to them, and move them to abide in it, hold it faſt, and not ſuffer themſelves by any pretences of Deceivers and falſe Apoſtles and Teachers to be waved therefrom. For the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:102366:95"/>
falſe Apoſtles uſed that artifice to ſupplant the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers from the belief of the truth, and turn them aſide from the faith, that the Serpent uſed at the firſt with our firſt Parents to turn them from their belief of, and obedience to Gods word to them, as the Apoſtle ſo ſignifies in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2, 3, 13, 14. that is as the Serpent to beguile <hi>Evah,</hi> pretended ſome want in their ſtate that God had ſet them in; and ſome great defect in that great proviſion or allowance that God afforded them; even ſo the falſe Teachers, as Meſſengers of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than did uſe to inſinuate to the Believers of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Doctrine, and ſo in and on Chriſt as ſet forth therein, that there was ſome defect and want in that object of their faith, and in the way in which they ſought juſtification and the favour of God; it was not a perfect and full way: but would they liſten to them, they would ſhew them a more perfect faith or doctrine, and ſo a more full and perfect object and ground of faith and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and way to happineſs than Chriſts Apoſtles had done, even as the Serpent perſwaded <hi>Evah,</hi> that there was ſome more excellent vertue and quality in the forbidden fruit to advance them &amp; make them like<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore in oppoſition to that ſubtle and falſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuation, and to fortifie the Believers mindes there againſt, the Apoſtle there ſtiles it the moſt holy ſaith, as implying the perfection of it, that none can or may adde any thing to it, to make it holier or better; the adding to it is the corrupting, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and perverting of it, ſo that whatſoever Doctrine ſhould add to, or alter it, ſhould be not
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:102366:95"/>
the more but leſs holy, nay indeed unholy: even as the adding any thing to the holy Oyntment under the Law ſpoiled it and rendred it unclean. This was an argument often made uſe of by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to arm the Believers againſt the falſe ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and canning ſlights of the falſe Apoſtles, as may be ſeen in divers paſſages of their Epiſtle.

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:102366:96"/>
might be aſſured, or might know againſt all the ſubtle, ſecret, and lying ſuggeſtions of the falſe Apoſtles to the contrary, perſwading them that that Doctrine of Chriſt and that faith in him that they had, would not ſuffice to eternal life, but that it was needful that they ſhould turn out to ſome new form of Doctrine and object of faith or adde ſomething (as the obſervation of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law) thereto, if they deſired to be ſaved; I ſay, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this, he tells them, he that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son hath not life; that the believers might know that they have eternal life, that they might know that they were in a ſure and certain way to it, and were at preſent by vertue of Chriſt believed in and had by them, heirs of it, and that in turning out from him and letting him go, they would deprive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of it, that ſo <hi>they might believe</hi> (that is, yet believe or continue to believe) <hi>in the name of the onely begotten Son of God,</hi> and not turn from him after any thing elſe, that the falſe Teachers might propound to them as better for them and more full and certain; that being the way to deprive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the good they were in, and of the life and happineſs they were in Chriſt, heirs of; as alſo to the ſame purpoſe is that in 2 <hi>John</hi> 9. where having warned them of deceivers, and wiſht them to look to themſelves, he adds, <hi>Whoſo tranſgreſſeth and abideth not in the Doctrine of Chriſt he hath not God; but whoſoever abideth in the Doctrine of Chriſt hath both the Father and the Son;</hi> yea, whereas it was a falſe ſuggeſtion of the falſe Apoſtles, that the Doctrine of <hi>Paul</hi> and of other his Brethren, and ſo Chriſt as held forth therein was not able to

make the receivers thereof holy or perfect, though it might do wel to enter them into the way of life, yet ſomething elſe was needful to be added to it, and further obſerved by them to perfect them, as is implied in that paſſage <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Are ye ſo fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, having begun in the Spirit, are ye made perfect by the fleſh,</hi> thoſe paſſages before recited (of letting <hi>that abide in them that they had heard from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning</hi>) namely, (in the firſt preaching of the Goſpel to them, and their hearing it) or what was delivered firſt of all, or in the firſt things (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.2, 3.) and that therein <hi>they ſhould have both Father and Son, and eternal life;</hi> (as alſo this expreſſion of the Apoſtle, that the faith on which they were founded, <hi>is the moſt holy Faith</hi>) meets with and oppoſes that falſe conception of thoſe deceivers, and implies, that there is nothing holier than this Doctrine, or Chriſt as held forth in it; nothing like it able to make them holy, to ſanctifie and devote them to God, and render them his choſen and beloved people; as the nature of holineſs ſtands in being ſeparated to God, and ſo owned, choſen of &amp; appropriated to him, nothing comparable in thoſe reſpects to this holy faith of theirs, <hi>your moſt holy faith;</hi> yea, and as the Apoſtle having ſaid to the <hi>Galatians, If we, or an Angel from Heaven preach unto you beſides what we have preached, let him he accurſed,</hi> adds in the next verſe, <hi>as I ſaid before, ſo ſay I again, If any man preach any other Goſpel than what ye have received, let him be accurſed?</hi> leaſt ſome falſe Apoſtles ſhould ſay, that they preacht no other Goſpel or Doctrine than <hi>Paul</hi> and his fellow Apoſtles preacht, only they gave them a better underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p n="1">1. That Believers are <hi>Gods building,</hi> as the Apoſtle calls them in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9. Thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this moſt holy Faith, they are thereby united with Chriſt, the precious, ſure foundation and corner-ſtone, and ſo as living or lively ſtones in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livened by that living Stone Chriſt, to whom they are come, <hi>They grow up into an holy ſpiritual houſe, an holy Temple and habitation for God by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:</hi> Yea, as Chriſt is both the Houſe and Temple of God himſelf <hi>(For in him dwells all the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Godhead bodily)</hi> and the foundation alſo of the Houſe or Church of God; ſo every Believer is both as the Temple of God, by vertue of Chriſt in whom he is (yea, their body is the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt) and is alſo a ſtone in the great Temple or ſpiritual building, and as God dwelt of old in his Temple of old at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> between the Cherubims of glory, not as to the comprehenſion of his Eſſence or Glory, but as to a ſignal and more eſpecial manifeſtation of his Power and Preſence, ſo God dwells in his Church and People that are in Chriſt, by way not of the comprehenſion of his Eſſence, but mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of his gracious preſence and diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his bleſſings. Chriſt, as held forth in the Apoſtles Doctrine, is the only foundation of this building. He is laid or built upon none of them, or their vertues, works or doings, but they are all brought to and built upon him by the holy Spirit.
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:102366:100"/>
And therefore alſo they ought carefully to cleave to Chriſt as their only Foundation, their Upholder and Sanctifier, by vertue of whoſe firmneſs and infinite ſtrength and fixedneſs, all they that abide or continue upon, or in the faith of him, are firm and ſtrong alſo, yea, <hi>As Mount</hi> Sion <hi>that can never be removed, but ſtandeth faſt for ever,</hi> Pſal. 125.1, 2. and by vertue of his holineſs and ſanctity, being Gods holy foundation, they are holy too to God, as an holy Temple or building, and therefore ought alſo to be clean, and chaſt, and holy in all things to him, as he that hath appointed it for his habitation and dwells therein, is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>

It will do us no hurt to acknowledge our own ſhortneſs and imperfection in our attainments, ſo we alſo acknowledge the fulneſs and perfection of the moſt holy faith, for perfecting us, and bringing us to the inheritance: yea, as it is dangerous for Believers, and leads to their deſtruction, to admit an imperfection and defect in the faith, for that will lay them open to impoſtures to corrupt them therefrom; ſo not to acknowledge their own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection and defect, to ſay they have no ſin, or have attained all fulneſs of knowledge and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or with the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> that <hi>They are rich, and increaſed with goods, and need nothing,</hi> is very dangerous and deſtructive to them alſo, laying them open to pride and puffings up in themſelves, as alſo to ſlothfulneſs, covetouſneſs and ſecurity, and by that means to ſail of the Grace of God, and to be deluded and carried captive of Satan to their own deſtruction. It implyes fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:102366:101"/>3. That their perfection in conformity to Chriſt, and attainments by Chriſt, is to be ſought for in abiding in their moſt holy Faith, and ſo by and from it, as it ſignifies the object or foundation of it, which is Chriſt; and by and through the the faith, as it ſignifies the Doctrine holding forth Chriſt. They are not to ſeek further growth and perfection by going away from that to ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doctrine as better fitted for that purpoſe, for then ſhould not this be the moſt holy faith, but that other doctrine ſhould be more holy than this; nor ſhould they build up themſelves thereon; but beſides this, as quitting and forſaking this, that they might be built up, or build up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on ſome other thing: but here they are to continue holding faſt that which they have heard and received. And to that purpoſe it is that the Apoſtle being about to leave the Elders of <hi>Epheſus</hi> and the Churches thereabout, <hi>commits them to God, and to the word of his Grace, as able to build them up, and to give them the inheritance,</hi> Act. 20: 32. and tells the <hi>Corinths,</hi> that they ſhould <hi>be ſaved in keeping in memory what they had received in the Goſpel preached by him from the beginning, or</hi> in the firſt things of it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.1, 2, 3. <hi>and</hi> 1.22, 23. So the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> too, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.24, 25. for this doctrine is not like that of the Law or firſt Teſtament, <hi>that made nothing perfect,</hi> but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is herein and herethrough to be attained, ſo far as we be capable of attaining it here; yea, to the inheritance it ſelf, alſo it is onely Chriſt as herein ſet forth that doth bring men. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine then or faith once delivered to the Saints, is not at any time to be waved, or altered
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:102366:102"/>
by us, but ſuffered to abide, and to be abid in by us; and on that Believers are to build up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who are yet in themſelves imperfect, &amp; ſtand in need of building. Its the foundation laid for them that upholds them and bears them up from ſinking; all their faith, hope, ſtay, comfort ſprings therefrom and ſtands thereupon; but it ſelf ſtands upon none of them, nor is added to or made more holy by them, yea, they themſelves as to their Spirits and ſpiritual conditions ſtand upon it; are what they are, as a Building for God from and by it, and in union with it; and beſides, that there is no ſtanding for them or any man; nothing to ſupport, relieve or comfort them againſt the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of the Law, and ſin, and Sathan, nothing elſe to ſecure them and keep them from periſhing in the wrath to come; no other Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for ſins to be found but what this preſents, nor otherwiſe than as this preſents, and therefore no forgiveneſs, juſtification or ſalvation, but upon and according to this faith and doctrine. All the bleſſing and fulneſs of God is here dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and ſure to be met with by thoſe that there ſeek and wait for him; and nothing but lies and emptineſs can any finde to uphold them, if this be turned from. No work or worth, no prayers or tears or acts of a man can help him that hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and is beſides this foundation; all the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore is to be on this: but then its to be inquired:</p>

            <p n="1">1. That as the believers are not yet perfect or moſt holy, as the foundation or faith is; ſo their growth up to perfection is gradual, not all at once attained, or in a moment but by degrees, in which they may be daily and always growing more and more: for this counſel or exhortation is for a continued uſefulneſs, a buſineſs that they

are always to look upon as their buſineſs, till they be brought to the actual poſſeſſion of eternal life, or ſo long as they live here amongſt men in the world. There is in this growth up into an holy Temple for the Lord, a <hi>going on from ſtrength to ſtrength,</hi> Pſal. 84.7, 8. a <hi>being changed into the image of the Lord, from Glory to Glory, as by his Spirit,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. ſo that believers may not at any time ſay, we are edified &amp; built up ſo fully already that we can build up our ſelves or be built up no further; though they are to be at a ſtay in reſpect of their foundation, the holy faith they are not to ſtraggle from that, yet as to their knowledge of it, and faith in it, and attainments from it, they may ſay as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> of himſelf, that they have <hi>not yet attained,</hi> while here, <hi>neither are already perfect: but this thing they do, forgetting the things that are behinde</hi> (the things they have let go for Chriſt) <hi>they preſs on forward toward the mark, for the prize of the high calling of God, in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus:</hi> and to preſs forward ſtill every day more and more, that they may <hi>apprehend that, for which they are alſo apprehended of Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Philip. 3.12, 13, 14. and ſo as the Apoſtle ſays to the <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians, edifie themſelves ſtill, even as they do,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.11. they did edifie one another, and yet he exhorts them ſtill to do ſo; there is ground for it, there is need of it; for as our Saviour ſays, <hi>So is the Kingdome of God,</hi> (the Grace of God in mens Souls in reſpect of the efficacie of it there) <hi>as when a man caſts ſeed upon the earth, and he ſleeps and wakes night and day, and the ſeed grows up and is increaſed no man knows how, for the Earth of its

Mark 4.26, 27, that is, the growth of the Grace of God in a man, or of a man in that Grace is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, indiſcernably, and leaſurely, not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and at once, but by divers ſteps and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; ſo that neither is any man to be diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, if he do not ſenſibly feel or perceive his growth in Grace, or that others ſo grow, but to go on edifying and furthering himſelf and others therein, in time <hi>their profiting will appear to all men.</hi> Nor are they to put a ſtop to their ſtanding in the earth, the Holy faith, or to their growth therein, but ſtill go on and abide riping and build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and building up themſelves till the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man when he ſees them fully ripe (as follows in that Parable <hi>ver.</hi> 29.) <hi>when the fruit yeelds forth it ſelf, or is brought forth, ſtraitways puts in his ſickle becauſe the harveſt is come,</hi> that is, till Chriſt take us away by death, we are to abide and grow.

            <p n="2">2. That this building up or edifying on the moſt holy faith, is a thing to which the believer is to be active not paſſive only. It's a work in ſome ſenſe put upon and required of the believer, not ſo to be wrought in &amp; upon them, as the building of a temple of wood and ſtones is a work wrought upon it, ſo as it contributes nothing therto by way of action, only is built up, but builds not it ſelf: both phraſes are uſed of believers, they <hi>are built up,</hi> ſays <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.21, 22. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.7. and yet alſo are ſaid to <hi>edifie,</hi> &amp; willed to <hi>build up themſelves,</hi> as here, and in 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.11. The former, becauſe believers have

            <p n="4">4. And in a word, the walking <hi>as becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> and ſo the ſhewing forth his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues in our converſations, in an innocent abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from all <hi>ungodlines &amp; fleſhly &amp; worldly luſts,</hi> &amp; walking <hi>ſoberly, &amp; righteouſly, and godlily in this preſent World,</hi> and in a patient bearing and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſo overcoming with goodneſs all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries and abuſes done to us, eſpecially for the Goſpels ſake, for that alſo tends exceedingly to the furtherance of the Goſpel and the confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtrengthning one another in the belief and confeſſion thereof. <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.12, 13, 14, 20, 27.

            <p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:102366:109"/>Now ſuch a building up our ſelves thereon, tends to keep us in the love of God, becauſe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. They that build up themſelves thereon, keep or abide thereon, and are not waved or turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide from that precious foundation, to which the love, ſpecial reſpect, care, and approbation of God are as it were intailed. Chriſt is the firſt, prime, and immediate object of Gods delightful love; ſo that a man being and abiding in him doth in, through and by vertue of him abide alſo in his love. Now a building up our ſelves on that foundation, is a firming us more in and faſtning us more upon him, who is that foundation whereon his love is inſeparably placed. <hi>The foundation of God</hi> (Jeſus Chriſt as held forth in the Apoſtles Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, for other foundations can no man lay) <hi>is a firm and ſure foundation, and ſtandeth ſure, having this Seal</hi> (or confirmation) <hi>the Lord knoweth them that are his.</hi> It is known of God as his, and therefore cared for, owned, and loved by him; and all that are his (the foundations or Chriſts) are therefore alſo known, owned, and accepted of God. <hi>If Chriſts, then Abrahams ſeed and heirs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to promiſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The building up our ſelves on that founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the moſt holy faith, is the way to keep our ſelves untouched of the adverſaries of it; and</p>

<pb facs="tcp:102366:110"/>
of Chriſt, and God will love us and Chriſt will love us, &amp; manifeſt his own ſelf to us,</hi> John 14.21. <hi>&amp; if we keep his Commandments we ſhall continue in his love, John</hi> 15.10. <hi>If we do theſe things</hi> (adde in our faith vertue, <hi>&amp;c</hi> &amp; ſo edifie and build up our ſelves on our moſt holy faith) <hi>we ſhall never fall, for ſo an abundant entrance ſhall be adminiſtred to us into the everlaſting Kingdome of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.5, 10; 11. It is <hi>the idle Soul ſhall ſuffer hunger;</hi> the barren and fruitleſs branch that the husband-man takes away, not the diligent and fruitful in good works, <hi>Joh</hi> 15.2. This therefore is the way for us to keep our ſelves in the love of God. Not to be careleſs and ſecure, and ſay in our hearts we cannot miſcarry; our ſtanding depends not on our working and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and therefore we will do nothing but give up our ſelves to minde and walk after the fleſh, and do our own pleaſures; for we are ſure of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, nothing can deprive us, Chriſt will keep it for us, and give it to us what ever we do, having cloſed with him and believed on him, no ſin of ours can un ſon us, nor no careleſneſs or neglect of ours provoke God to neglect us.

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. And firſt. To pray is more than to ſay or read or frame a prayer, for that may be as to the two former, an exerciſe of the tongue and lips, in which the heart may be altogether unexerciſed; yea, and it may be other mens deſires or needs that we ſay or read over and not our own. And as to the laſt expreſſion, the framing of a prayer it may be but an exerciſe of the brain &amp; parts, not of the heart and Spirit of a man; yea, the Stage-Players have done all this in deriſion of prayer ſometime; whereas to pray is,</p>
            <p>To exerciſe the heart in minding, uttering, or pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out unto God through Jeſus Chriſt its needs and deſires, or the needs of and its deſires for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; let us view the particulars, and ſo,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Prayer is an exerciſe of the heart thence, <hi>When God ſaid, ſeek ye my face, my heart</hi> (ſays <hi>David) ſaid, thy face, Lord, will I ſeek</hi> Pſa. 27.9. and a man is ſaid in prayer <hi>to pour out his heart,</hi> as in Pſa. 62.8. <hi>Truſt in God at all times, ye people, pour out your hearts unto him: He is a refuge for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:102366:111"/>
7.17. David ſays, <hi>He found in his heart to pray this prayer to God.</hi> It is true, the heart may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in reading or ſaying a prayer, ſo as to joyn in the words of it heartily, as what it ſees it needs and deſires be, and the exerciſe of the heart, ſo in reading or ſaying a prayer may be and is a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: but whether men read or ſay, or frame and compoſe prayers by their parts, if their hearts be not engaged therein, but onely their lips and tongue or brains, its not a praying, there may be the carkaſs or form of a prayer, but the inſide of it is wanting, and its but a dead image. But when the heart is exerciſed, though there be nothing read or ſaid outwardly and audibly to the ear of man, yet it may be a right and fervent praying, as in the caſe of <hi>Hannah,</hi> 1 Sam. 1.13. <hi>who ſpake in her heart, and only her lips moved;</hi> the heart may do well enough in prayer without the voice of the lips and tongue, but they without it ſignifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Gods reckonings. Its <hi>a vain worſhip when</hi> men <hi>draw nigh to God with the lips, and honour him with the tongue, but the heart is removed far from him,</hi> Iſa. 29.17. It's an exerciſe of the heart, that's the firſt thing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It's an exerciſe of the heart, in which the heart minds the needs of it ſelf or others; indeed this alone may be without praying, but yet pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cannot be without this in one branch of it, as it is for it ſelf, it mindes its own needs or wants, and as it is for others, it mindes their needs, either more generally, or in particular, for there can be no hearty deſire of ſupplies where there is no heart-minding of the needs to be ſupplied. The heart firſt gathers and takes into it ſelf by its conſideration or mindfulneſs, the needs to be ſupplied before it,

And this <hi>is one thing</hi> in the <hi>preparation of the heart to pray</hi> to God, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.19. that God brings to minde, and makes it ſenſible and apprehenſive of the needs or wants of it ſelf or others, and helps it to conſider or lay them to heart: an inconſiderate heart can never be a good praying heart, thence alſo <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> thus expreſſes himſelf, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.37. <hi>If they ſhall bethink themſelves — and turn and pray,</hi> &amp;c. yea, thence alſo prayer is ſometime called a <hi>Meditation of the heart,</hi> as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Conſider my Meditation.</hi> That's the ſecond.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It's an exerciſe of the heart uttering and pouring out its needs, which it may doe either by the mouth and lips, alſo imployed, as, <hi>hear the prayer that proceeds not out of feigned lips,</hi> 17.1. and again, <hi>I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue.</hi> And, I <hi>cryed unto God with my voice unto God with my voice did I cry,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.17. and 77.1. or it may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the voice, as was noted above of <hi>Hannah,</hi> for the heart hath a ſecret ſpeech and cry too, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible to God, when yet men hear nothing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. But whether with audible voice or without, this pouring out or uttering the needs from or by the heart is eſſential to prayer; which therefore is called <hi>the pouring out of the heart,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.8. before noted, and <hi>the pouring out of the Soul,</hi> 1 Sam. 1.15. or, <hi>of the complaint,</hi> Pſal. 142.2.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is an uttering the needs and deſires of the heart, and that's it which moſt properly renders
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:102366:112"/>
it prayer, the breathing forth deſires by way of petition, requeſt, or humble ſupplication for the ſupply of our needs. It is not only this I need or want which may be without prayer properly ſo called; But, Lord, give or grant me this, or that the need whereof I am ſenſible of, as in <hi>Solomons</hi> prayer for Wiſdome, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 3.7, 8. <hi>O Lord my God, Thou haſt made me thy ſervant King in ſtead of David my Father, and I am but a little Child, I know not how to go out or come in</hi> (there's the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering his need, and then <hi>ver.</hi> 9.) <hi>Give therefore thy ſervant an underſtanding heart to judge thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> &amp;c. So in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 60.11. <hi>Give us help from trouble for vain is the help of man:</hi> yea, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the goodneſs of the thing may be more in the praying begetting deſires of it than ſimply the want of it, as he that askes a thing, that he hath taſted the ſweetneſs of more out of delight in it, than need of it, thence prayer is expreſt by <hi>asking, ſeeking, knocking, making known our requeſts,</hi> &amp;c. as <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.7, 8. <hi>Philip.</hi> 4.6.

            <p n="3">3. As to the earneſtneſs in praying.

The holy Ghoſt in glorifying Chriſt, &amp; ſetting forth to us, his great love towards us, diſcovers the great humility of Chriſt; yea, and of God in Chriſt to <hi>humble himſelf, to take notice of the things in Heaven and in earth, to raiſe up the poor from the duſt, and the needy from the dung-hill, to ſet them on the Throne with Princes,</hi> Pſal. 113.5, 6, 7, 8. eſpecially as manifeſted in the perſon of Chriſt <hi>who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but emptied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, humbled himſelf, and made himſelf of no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, but took upon him the forme of a ſervant, and was made in the likeneſs of man, and being found in faſhion as a man humbled himſelf to the death, the death of the Croſs,</hi> in which he alſo diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the great cauſe we have to be humbled, low and little in our own eyes, for in teſtifying the love of Chriſt to us, <hi>that he died for all,</hi> he teſtifies alſo of us all, that <hi>we were dead,</hi> dead at Law, and ſuch as deſerved to have died, and were thereto condemned: ſo that had not Chriſt died for us, we ſhould have periſhed. Our miſery was ſuch, that no leſſer price could ranſome us therefrom, no leſſer Sacrifice could make an expiation for us.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:102366:122"/>
He that prays in the mindefulneſs &amp; ſenſe of theſe things will be abaſed and laid low in the preſence of God, as knowing not only the great diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between God and him as his creature, duſt &amp; aſhes (as <hi>Abraham</hi> had the ſenſe of that with him in his ſpeaking to God when he ſaid, <hi>Behold, now I have taken upon me to ſpeak to the Lord who am but duſt &amp; aſhes,</hi> Gen. 18.27.) but alſo the wretchednes and ſinfulneſs of our natures, and that what we are or have that is good, we are and have it only and wholly of his Grace. <hi>In us in our fleſh, there dwells no good thing;</hi> nothing worthy of Gods acceptance; yea, that <hi>all our righteouſneſſes are but as filthy rags,</hi> Iſa. 64.6. And ſo he that prays in the Holy Ghoſt prays in all lowlineſs of minde, and ſuch reverence of the outward man as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes God's height and goodneſs, and his own vileneſs, confeſſing his own ſins and ſinfulneſs, though yet with confidence in Gods mercy through Chriſt Jeſus, as above.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Yea, He that prays in the Holy Ghoſt prays in an acknowledgment of the Grace and goodneſs of God towards mankinde and towards himſelf in particular with thankfulneſs; and ſo joyns thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving for his mercies and benefits with his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Petitions for further mercies that he wants; and doth not ſo pore upon his wants and troubles, and deſire freedom from them, as to ſet nothing by all Gods benefits before conferred. So the Apoſtles, as was alſo noted above, exhort to joyn thanksgiving with our prayers, as moſt clear to that purpoſe is that in <hi>Philip.</hi> 4 6, 7. <hi>In no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be careful, but in all things by prayer and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:102366:123"/>
with thanksgiving let your requeſts be made known to God.</hi> An unthankful, murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing complaining temper, is not of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p n="7">7. In a ſubmiſſive frame of Spirit (which alſo alſo is a fruit of humility before ſpoken of) in which though the heart be filled with earneſtneſs and confidence in God for what he ſees needful and good for it ſelf and others, yet it reſignes it ſelf to Gods will as for time and way; yea, and in things not abſolutely needful for Gods granting or withholding them, even as Chriſt though earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in praying that the Cup might paſs from him, yet ſubmitted his will to his Fathers, <hi>Father if it be poſſible, let this cup paſs from me, yet not my will, but thy will be done,</hi> Matth. 26, 39. to which we may alſo refers a patient tarrying the Lords lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and not making haſte or turning away from God, or ceaſing to pray to him, if we have not preſently granted the thing that we ask. For as the Spirit of God is a ſpirit of Faith, ſo alſo of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient waiting, that being a fruit of faith. <hi>He that believeth maketh not haſte,</hi> Iſa. 28.16. Such is the praying in the holy Ghoſt, not to mention any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particulars. And that's the ſecond thing inquired.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third is; what is implied in exhorting believers ſo to pray. And that is divers things, as,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That believers are not able or ſufficient of themſelves, as of themſelves to keep themſelves in the love of God, or to that purpoſe to edifie or build up themſelves on their moſt holy faith. They need the help and furtherance of God and his
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:102366:123"/>
Grace thereunto. In all their minding his Grace, exerciſe of their gifts, walking in Charity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they need to look to God for direction and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and for his ſtrength and aſſiſtance they need him to build them up in their building up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to keep watch over them, in all keeping themſelves and watching over themſelves and one another. <hi>Except the Lord build the houſe</hi> (in this ſenſe too) <hi>they labour but in vain, that build it. And except the Lord watch over the City, the watchman watcheth but in vain,</hi> Pſal. 127.1, 2. their ſtrength being ſo ſmall, and their enemies ſo many and ſo great.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That there is ſufficient Grace in God and Chriſt for their helpfulneſs therein, and that alſo communicable to them by him: by which they may be built up and ſo be kept in his love, all the oppoſitions from without them or from within them, notwithſtanding. If they had ſufficiencie in and of themſelves, or in what they have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy received, then need they not cry unto God continually for more from him; or if there were none in him for them, to be afforded to them, than no ground or incouragement for their crying to him, however much they might want, but in willing them to pray in their build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up themſelves both are implied, we need like the builders of the wall in <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> time to fight with one hand and to build with the other, and the former by praying to, and calling upon God; <hi>for ſo ſhall we be ſaved from our enemies,</hi> Pſal. 18.3. for we are not led to pray to a God that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſave, but to him who is mighty in power, able to ſave us, one that can perform all things for us
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:102366:124"/>
as being Almighty, able to doe all things,, and hath made ready in Chriſt all ſupplies of Grace and Bleſſing for us: <hi>all things are ready</hi> that may conduce unto our protection and preſervation in his Grace, and the edifying our ſelves in our moſt holy faith, as well as for bringing us at firſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That yet God will be ſought unto and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on for the ſupplies of his Grace to us: he will have us in that way exerciſe our faith in him, in calling upon him, though he could give us without our asking, and doth give us and doe much for us before we ask, to move and incourage us to look to him and ask of him for more; yet he will have us accuſtome our ſelves in that exerciſe of prayer to him; to that purpoſe are many paſſages in Scripture, as, <hi>Call upon me in the time of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie me,</hi> Pſal. 50.15. ſo in <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.3. <hi>Call unto me and I will anſwer thee, and ſhew thee great and mighty things which thou knoweſt not,</hi> Ezek. 36: 37. God having promiſed to do great things for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet ſays, <hi>For this he will yet be inquired of by them.</hi> And our Saviour bids <hi>ask, ſeek, knock,</hi> and ſo they ſhould <hi>receive, find, and have it opened to them,</hi> Matth. 7.7, 8. And this God will have his people do:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they might therein exerciſe and ſhew forth their faith in him, and dependance on him for his Grace, while they goe to him for all things, as a child to his Father, or as a wife to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. Therefore it is noted in Scripture as a fruit and conſequent of faith, <hi>with the heart
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:102366:124"/>
man believeth unto righteouſneſs, and then with the mouth confeſſion is made to Salvation, for whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver calleth upon the Name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Rom. 10.10, 11, 12, 13.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That they may have more acquaintance and intercourſe with God, and not live as ſtrangers from him, but by calling often upon him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving anſwers of Grace from him, have a holy familiarity and communion with him; as perſons dayly reſorting to the Court and ſpeaking to the King, and preſenting Petitions to him, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving anſwers from him, thereby get more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him, and acquaintance with him; and ſo are fitted the better for going out and publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to others the manner of his entertainment of mens ſuits, and the vertues and goodneſs they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern in him. Children that ſcarce ever come and ſpeak to their Father grow ſtrange to him; and ſo do men that make little uſe of this priviledge of coming nigh unto God; whereas ſuch as come dayly to him to ask favours of him gather good acquaintance and proof of his love and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to them; <hi>David</hi> implies this, in ſaying, <hi>Oh, taſte and ſee that the Lord is good,</hi> Pſal. 34.8. and <hi>Eliphaz</hi> in ſaying to <hi>Job, Acquaint</hi> (or accuſtome) <hi>thy ſelf now with God,</hi> Job. 22.21.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To keep them in a more reverend awe of him, leſt they ſhould offend him, and ſo put a barr againſt their own petitions to him; for as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that have often occaſion to come before their Parents will be more careful of dirtying or ſoyling their cloathes, or tearing and renting them, or of doing any thing unbecoming them, if they know
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:102366:125"/>
their parents cannot like to ſee them in ſuch a caſe; whereas they that ſeldome come into then ſight, grow more looſe and careleſs, dirtied and torn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> even ſo God foreſees that if we did not come often to him we would be little careful of our converſation before him; whereas <hi>ſeeing we call upon the Father, who without reſpect of perſons judgeth every man righteouſly according to his works,</hi> therefore it behoves us <hi>to paſs the time of our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journing here in fear,</hi> and take heed that we <hi>regard not iniquity in our hearts,</hi> becauſe that wil provoke God to hide himſelf from us, &amp; <hi>not hear our prayers.</hi> That he might make us therefore ſtand in awe of him, and be perfect with him, he makes us to be often waiting upon him in his preſence and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging at his door for Grace and Mercy to help us in our needs, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.18.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To give us more experience of his care over us, and notice taking of us, and ſo of his love to us, in that he hears our prayers and helps us. Did we not pray unto him we ſhould not have that experience, that his <hi>eyes are open upon us,</hi> and his <hi>eares attentive to our prayers,</hi> we ſhould look upon mercies as proceeding from ſome other cauſes, &amp; be more obnoxious to atheiſtical principles; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the experience of his nighneſs to us gives us a more full proof of his care over us, and ſo of his being, power, goodneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. To incite us to a more love and thankfulneſs to him, as we have more acquaintance and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity with him, and experience of his kindneſs to us; and ſo alſo to forgive and doe good to one another: as knowing that we do often need and receive forgiveneſs from him, and manifold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:102366:125"/>
and favours upon our asking; yea, oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times above what we either ask or think.</p>
            <p n="6">6. To provoke us to more humble and lowly demeanour of our ſelves before him and towards one another, while we are always as beggars, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging our own wants and weakneſſes, and inſufficiencie of our ſelves, and our dependance for all good things upon him, and have often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the diſtempers of our own hearts &amp; oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of confeſſing and bewailing them that we might not bear up our ſelves as Lords, that need to be beholding to God in nothing.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That we might have more proof and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the vertuouſneſs of Chriſts Sacrifice and Mediation for us in making our prayers accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and procuring Grace and bleſſing for us, and gracious anſwers to us; for theſe and the like reaſons God will be ſought unto by us; which was the third thing implied in that phraſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Here is alſo further implied and ſignified to us, that of and by our ſelves, though we have need to pray to God continually, yet we know not how to pray as we ought, but are apt to offend and goe wrong therein, to vent forth our paſſions, or our corrupt and carnal deſires and affections, ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, pride, revenge, covetouſneſs, diſtruſtfulneſs, murmurings, or the like, and therefore need the directions and helpfulneſs of another, wiſer and holier than our ſelves, even the Holy Ghoſt, the breath and Spirit of God, to infuſe light and truth into us, and direct and guide us thereby, and frame our hearts aright therein, that we may pray acceptably to God by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, and

no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> looſe our labour in praying, or procure a curſe to our ſelves in ſtead of a bleſſing.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That God hath not left us, nor doth leave us unto our own wiſdom, parts and abilities to guide us in our prayers, and frame our prayers and deſires for us; nor yet leave us to preſcribed formes, and external directions and impoſitions of others to ſupply our weakneſſes and inabilities to pray, but gives his holy Spirit to thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him and obey him, to help them in their prayers to him, that they may <hi>offer up ſpiritual Sacrifices</hi> in him <hi>acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Act. 5.31, 32. Joh. 7.37, 38. Rom. 8.26, 27. 1 Pet. 2.5. which Holy Spirit being in and with God in Chriſt and proceeding thence is acquainted with the minde of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 26, 27. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10. and diſcovers to the believer what the minde and will of God is in thoſe things that concern him to pray for; ſo far at leaſt as to direct to pray acceptably thereabout to him, he being <hi>a Spirit of wiſdom and Revelation in the knowledge of Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 1.17, 18. and frames the heart ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the minde and will of God in praying, and begets longing deſires and <hi>groans that cannot be uttered in them.</hi> So that he that hath bleſſings to beſtow on us, and hath revealed it to be his mind that we ſhould ſeek them of him, and hath opened a way for us in and by his Son for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to him, and pouring out our hearts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, pitying our ignorances and inabilities, hath provided, promiſed, and faithfully affords his own holy Spirit in the teachings, operations, and efficacie of it, to inable us to pray to him in
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:102366:126"/>
that way, and for thoſe things that he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for us, and ſet before us: and for ſuch ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Sacrifices or prayers, Chriſt is appointed alſo the High-Prieſt to take away the iniquities that cleave to them, as there is in them any thing of our ignorance, error, and miſtake, and to make them acceptable to him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That God having done all this for us, and affording ſuch help to us as is ſuitable to his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and our needs requires of us, not to neglect this his Grace, not to worſhip in the oldneſs of the Letter, in form and faſhion, and outſide one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or in our own wit, parts, and wills, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but in Spirit and truth in all things, <hi>watching unto and in prayer,</hi> that we pray in and according to the light and direction that he gives us in the Goſpel, asking onely ſuch things, and in ſuch way and manner as the Goſpel inſtructs us; and in ſuch a frame of Spirit as the Holy Ghoſt therein begets and nouriſhes in us in attending to the Grace of Chriſt as therein ſet before us, and keeping that (which is the miniſtration of the holy Spirit, the very air as it were in which it breaths) in our hearts and mindes to direct and lead us. They therefore do evilly that neglect the Goſpel and the holy Ghoſt, as breathing therethrough in us, and take up other ways and helps in ſtead thereof, and eſpecially ſuch as would tie up men to other helps, as forms and impoſitions of words &amp; frames; as if God gave not his holy Spirit now to help his ſervants. And it may be obſerved that ſince the giving of the holy Spirit to thoſe that believe in Chriſt, we finde no formes of prayer invented,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:102366:127"/>
propoſed, or impoſed by Chriſt or his Apoſtles upon men as there were before he was given ſo to them, and received by them. Though in caſe of the ignorance and inſufficiencie of the Miniſtry (which yet the Biſhops ought not to ſuffer, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide and put in ſuch as are ſufficient and well qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified according to thoſe rules in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. and <hi>Tit.</hi> 1) or to prevent mens diſorderly prayings that ſome good and unexceptionable forms may be preſcribed for publike Aſſemblies.

               </gap>. upon ſome ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts it may ſeem that Chriſt preſcribed.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That poſſibly men may, yea, believers alſo, and too often doe, neglect the help of the Holy Spirit, yea, and may too often neglect prayer it ſelf, reſtraining prayer before God, and not pouring out their hearts therein to him; but ſeek by other means to defend and keep themſelves, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the aſſaults of enemies, and that if they do pray, yet they may not pray in the holy Ghoſt, in what light and inſtruction he gives them in and by the Doctrine of Chriſt, and in his operations therethrough in their hearts: and ſo in ſuch faith, love, charity, humility, reſignation of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the will of God, earneſtneſs and for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie as becomes them, and as the Grace of God and his Goſpel inſtructs to; and his holy Spirit therethrough believed and minded, uſes to work in men, and frame their hearts to, but may poſſibly, as too often they doe, reſt in ſome forms, or if not ſo, yet pray in their own ſelfiſh, ignorant, carnal ſpirit, asking thoſe things that ſuite their wills and humours and luſts, their own advancement, glory, eaſe, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> and not thoſe
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:102366:127"/>
things that tend to the glory of Chriſt and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of his Name, praiſe and Kingdom in the world, and in ſuch an evil, ſelfiſh; peeviſh, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable, proud, paſſionate diſtemper of ſpirit, as the wiſdom or will of the fleſh begets or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces in men; and not in ſuch a frame and efficacie as is of Gods ſpirit, which kinde of praying is diſpleaſing to God, who being a Spirit, will be worſhipped by men in ſpirit and truth, and cannot accept or like of that that is not of his holy ſpirit; and therefore alſo is unprofitable to men and tends not to build them up in the moſt holy faith: whence need for exhorting believers, and for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers to accept the exhortation, both to pray, and to ſee that they doe it aright, not in any ſpiritleſs, formal way, or in any carnal and unholy Spirit, but in the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That this praying in the holy Ghoſt is a good means to edifie the believers in their moſt moſt holy Faith, and ſo for keeping them in the love of God; for therefore this clauſe is joyned with them, and joyned with them in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeaking, as clearly denotes and implies it to be a means to them. For in ſaying, <hi>Building up your ſelves on your moſt holy Faith, praying in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> he ſhews, that the building up themſelves on their moſt holy faith would not goe well on, if truſting to their own power and skill, therein they ſhould neglect Gods help, or neglect to pray and call upon God for it in ſuch a way as he might accept them, and ſend them help. Therefore they were to doe that with the former action as a means to it, and then in coupling the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:102366:128"/>
counſel to both thoſe, and that abſolutely by a Verb or word of command or counſel, <hi>Keep your ſelves in the love of God;</hi> and mentioning both of thoſe by a Participle, as having reference to ſome further end, namely, that expreſſed in that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing counſel: he implies, that they be both of them means to that great end; or that ſuch a building themſelves on their moſt holy Faith, as is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed with praying in the Holy Ghoſt, will much conduce to, or is the means to preſerve and keep themſelves in the love of God: Which leads us to the next enquiry, namely,</p>
            <p n="4">4. How the praying in the Holy Ghoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces to the keeping our ſelves in the love of God. To which it is to be minded (as was noted above) that the love or peculiar favour of God, and his bleſſing, is fixed upon the foundation, or moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith in the firſt place. It firſtly faſtens upon, and imbraces Chriſt his beloved delightful one, who is the great ſubject of the Goſpel Doctrine, and for his ſake it is, upon or with that Doctrine alſo, as it ſets forth and contains his name, and is the means to glorifie him to men, and to draw in men to him, ſo as his eye and heart is thereupon as a moſt holy thing to him, the ſlighters of which he will ſlight and puniſh with more intolerable judgements than thoſe upon <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah;</hi> as in <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.15. and thoſe that receive and embrace, that are imbraced and beloved of him, ſo as to be rewarded with life everlaſting, <hi>John</hi> 5.24. <hi>He that heareth my words</hi> (which he gave to his Apoſtles, and they preached in his name) <hi>and believeth on him that ſent me, hath everlaſting life,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that believeth, and
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:102366:128"/>
is baptized</hi> (namely into Chriſt) <hi>ſhall be ſaved,</hi> &amp;c. Thence it follows that that which furthers mens being edified and built up on that moſt holy faith, doth alſo further their being and abiding in that love and favour of God which he bears toward thoſe that are thereupon for the ſake thereof. And ſo praying in the Holy Ghoſt, conduces to the keeping men in the love of God, as it is a means to keep them on their moſt holy Faith: And a means thereto it is, both,</p>
            <p n="1">1. As there is no praying in the Holy Ghoſt, but by and from the moſt holy Faith, Jeſus Chriſt, and the Doctrine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of him taken heed unto, and minded by men: Praying in the H. Gh. then, argues a being on the moſt holy Faith, and exerciſes men to it, even to the holding to, and minding of it; becauſe the Holy Spirit is not otherwiſe to be met with to breath in us, and frame our hearts to ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and right deſires and prayers, but on that moſt holy Faith; for the Holy Spirit is onely that way miniſtred, namely, <hi>By the hearing of Faith, and not by the works of the Law,</hi> much leſs by any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions and works in obedience to other Laws, or in any lawleſs courſes, <hi>Gal</hi> 33.3.

And it is in the Name and Doctrine of Chriſt, as Chriſt is therein named and ſet forth, that the Holy Spirit breathes unto and in men therein, and makes it a Miniſtration of Spirit, or a means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying the light, power, preſence and influence of the Spirit; which is therefore no further abiding in men, and leading and framing them, than that Word and Doctrine of Chriſt in which he is mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, and Chriſt as held forth therein, is received by, and abides in men, and they in them. Whence that in 2 <hi>John</hi> 9. <hi>Whoſo tranſgreſſeth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Chriſt, hath not God</hi> (to wit, by his Holy Spirit in and with them; for ſo God dwells in Believers, namely by his Spirit, as in Epheſ. 2.21.) <hi>Whoſo abideth in the doctrine of Chriſt, hath both the Father and the Son;</hi> namely, in and by the influence and preſence of the Spirit of both in and with them, as well as in other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations for them. So then he that prayeth in the Holy Ghoſt, being on the moſt holy Faith, and ſo in Chriſt, in whom and for whoſe ſake God ſo loveth and favoureth men, as we have ſhewed, muſt needs be in the love of God, and the praying in the Holy Ghoſt, a means to keep men in the love of God, becauſe it is a way to keep men in Chriſt, and a fruit of their keeping in him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Again, it muſt needs be a means to preſerve Believers in the love of God, as it is a means to obtain further grace from God, for more building up themſelves on their moſt holy Faith, where the love of God runs, and is certainly enjoyed; for what men ask of God, believing in Chriſt, and in the name of Chriſt, as the Holy Spirit inſtructs and moves them, they do ſurely receive it of God; as

Now this is one main thing that the Holy Spirit inſtructs and leads ſuch as be led by him in their prayers, to deſire and pray for, That they may be more confirmed, rooted and built up on their moſt holy Faith, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:102366:136" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the building from falling, if well laid upon it, and cemented to it; as it is a great diſcouragement, and may weaken the hands to ſuſpect the foundation not good and firm; but here's no cauſe to doubt of that, <hi>The foundation of God ſtands firm, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this Seal, the Lord knows them that are his,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. we may go on boldly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him, and to exerciſe faith, and incourage our hearts in hope from the conſideration of him: <hi>For he that believeth and hopeth in him ſhall not be aſhamed,</hi> becauſe he is a precious <hi>corner-ſtone, a ſure foundation,</hi> Iſa. 28.16. His perſon is ſo great and honourable, none may compare with him; we cannot doubt his power and ability to ſave us, his graciouſneſs with his Father in all his addreſſes to him on our behalf to him, becauſe he is his only begotten Son; yea, and becauſe he being ſuch an one hath perfectly obeyed him and offered up himſelf in Sacrifice to him through the eternal Spirit, wherein he hath ſo pleaſed God his Father, made ſuch an atonement for our ſins, obtained ſuch a Redemption, ſuch forgiveneſs of ſins, is ſo powerful an High-Prieſt in the vertues of it with God for us, and is ſo faithful and ſo merciful to us, and what he hath in obeying his Father for us, and minding our intereſt to the Death, the Death of the Croſs, is ſo full of vertue and he's ſo full of bleſſing upon the account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and ſo able and alſufficient to confer it upon us, to the ſaving us from all evil and ſatisfying us with all good: that there is great, yea, moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect reaſon and ground for us to look too, and cloſe with him, believe in him, come to and reſt upon him, and ſo to go on, liſtening to and obeying

him, and holding faſt the profeſſion of our Faith concerning him. There cannot be a better, ſurer, and fuller foundation for us to build on, no Rock like him our God; none ſo able to ſave us, none beſide him provided for us, and given to us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Yea, He is not only the moſt ſure foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo perfect as nothing can be added to him to make him more ſure and firm, and ſo to add firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to us from him, but alſo the moſt holy, moſt conſecrated, divine, acceptable to God, known and approved, and beloved of God; ſo holy, as that he, by and through the knowledge of himſelf in this Doctrine that ſets him forth is moſt meet and fit to infuſe holineſs into us, and devote us to God, and make us to be owned and approved of, alſo by him, and to be delighted in, and inhabited of him. We have all the incouragement therefore here to build, that a foundation can poſſibly give us, we cannot have a ſurer, ſtronger, more bleſſed ground than this is; therefore build we up our ſelves here on your moſt holy faith.</p>
            <p n="3">3.

            <p n="4">4. This we have to encourage us therein, that he hath not onely, in and through the moſt holy ſaith, given us ſome furniture of gifts, underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the edifying our ſelves and one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other thereon; but alſo ſtands ready in and through his bleſſed Son, further to aſſiſt, direct and help us, and to carry on the building in, and for us, by his own grace and power ſupplied to us: Which we may alſo have and receive from him according to our needs, upon ſeeking it of him, and calling upon him by prayer and ſupplication for it, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as our Lord hath ſaid, <hi>Ask, and ye ſhall receive, ſeek, and ye ſhall find; knock, and it ſhall be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you: for every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that ſeeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh, it ſhall be opened,</hi> Matth. 7.7, 8. <hi>And if ye that are evil, know how to give good gifts to your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, how much more will your heavenly Father give the holy Spirit to them that ask him,</hi> Luke 11.13.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Yea, and whereas we are fooliſh and bruitiſh in, and of our ſelves, and not onely want ability to build up our ſelves of our ſelves, but alſo skill to pray unto God for his help and holy Spirit as we ought: he to help us there alſo, in and through the foundation we are upon, even the moſt holy faith, gives us the Holy Ghoſt to help our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and teach us how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that what remains, but that we up and be doing, build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up our ſelves on our moſt holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghoſt, and to keep our ſelves in the love of God.</p>
            <p>To which the Apoſtle adds in the next place,</p>
            <p>The manner how we are to do all this, or the poſture we are therein to ſtand in; and that is, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt unto Eternal life: In a waiting poſture for further mercy, even the mercy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt unto Eternal life. Where we have,
<list>
                  <item>1. The Poſture it ſelf, <hi>Waiting.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. The Object to be waited for, <hi>Mercy:</hi> Which is further declared what it is by,
<list>
                        <item>1. The Author of it, or Fountain of it, whoſe, and whence it is; <hi>viz. The mercy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. The Tendency, iſſue and end of it, <hi>

                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. In that it is ſaid, <hi>Waiting,</hi> it is implied and ſignified,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Believers ſo edifying themſelves on their moſt holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghoſt, may and ſhould hope and look for the further grace, mercy and helpfulneſs of Chriſt, and God in Chriſt: for waiting for a thing, implies hoping for it, as Rom. 8.24, 25. <hi>If we hope for what we ſee not, then
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:102366:139" rendition="simple:additions"/>
do we with patience wait for it.</hi> Believers are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hope of good; for Good is always the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of hope; and waiting, ſomething that the ſoul looks upon as good for it, and it is real good that the ſoul is inſtructed of God, to look after and wait for. Now hoping alſo implies,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That what the ſoul waits for, is not yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed. The ſoul hath not an enjoyment of all that is good for it, though it be in the love of God, the fountain of all good and mercy, yet it hath not an actual enjoyment or poſſeſſion of all the good that flows forth from that fountain. Hope is of things future, not yet ſeen or enjoyed; <hi>for that that is ſeen is not hope, for what a man ſeeth, why doth he yet hope for,</hi> Rom. 8 15. The Believer, though in the love of God, and his favour, yet is not fully built up, as we ſee before, and therefore is not poſſeſſed all that he is building up for, or that is intended to him when built up. <hi>We are ſaved now by hope,</hi> not by actual ſight and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The hope of further good, is that that bears up the ſoul againſt, and under the ſight &amp; feeling of preſent evils. The condition of the Believer here, is not to be above or beyond hope, but to be in hope; a lively or living hope, by or through the Reſurrection of Chriſt, as 1 Pet. 1.3. not a dead, empty hope, that puts no activity into the ſoul. <hi>Hope is the anchor</hi> of the ſoul, that enters into the Mercy-ſeat and Glory within the vail, that ſtays the ſoul now up from ſinking under any diſcouragements in the building time, from ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies within or without that oppoſe and threaten it, or from any tryals or preſſures that may lie upon it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It implies an apprehenſion of ſome good
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:102366:139" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ground of the expectation of the good that it yet hath not, but waits for, and ſo it believes that good will come to it that it yet hath not: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the moſt holy faith affords it good ground for ſuch an expectation of good; for <hi>faith is the evidence of things not ſeen, and the ground of things hoped for,</hi> Hebr. 11.1. Therefore being on that ground, it muſt needs ſee reaſon and cauſe to hope: For therein is diſcovered and declared,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That God ſo loved and pitied them, while in and of the world, as that he ſent his onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son, and delivered him up to death for us all, even while ungodly, ſinners and enemies againſt him, to the end that believing in him, they ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life, <hi>Job.</hi> 3.16.17. And <hi>if he ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him freely give us all things,</hi> Rom. 8.32. <hi>Having when we were enemies, reconciled us to himſelf by the death of his Son, how much more ſhall we be ſaved by his life,</hi> Chap. 5.10.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Jeſus Chriſt, according to the will of God his Father, hath actually come forth and been manifeſted in a body of fleſh, and dyed for our ſins, ſuffering the juſt for the unjuſt, that he might bring us to God, being made a curſe that he might redeem us from the curſe of the Law, and from under the obligation too of ſeeking righteouſneſs by the Law, and ſo of living or dying according as we fulfilled or fell ſhort of that, that ſo we might receive the adoption of children, that we might be taken into Gods houſe, and into more near relation to him, and be provided for of all things good for us freely by him. And he that
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:102366:140"/>
dyed for us to theſe ends, to take away thoſe evils that hindred and ſtopt up the paſſages of all good, is riſen again as a perſon that hath done and compleated his work he undertook to do by dying, hath paid our debts, ſatisfied for our ſins, and is therefore acquitted and juſtified of God, and raiſed up again to proſecute and purſue our good further in the power of God; and this, <hi>that our hope might be in God,</hi> as in 1 Pet. 1.21. Now ſeeing that he in Chriſts death hath removed what might hinder, on his part, good from us, and hath raiſed up him that had ſuch love to us as to die for us, to remove what might hinder our good, on our parts &amp; to be the Author of good to us; the ſoul ſees good ground thence of lively hope, and is <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten to a lively hope</hi> of a glorious inheritance <hi>by the Reſurrection of Chriſt from the dead,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.3. wherein it was made manifeſt that Chriſt hath aboliſhed the death, and obtained life and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs for us: Eſpecially, ſince,</p>
            <p n="3">3. That Jeſus Chriſt that dyed for us, and roſe again, is now on the right hand of God, Angels, and Thrones, and Principalities being made ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to him, ſo as he hath ſupreme power over all things for our good; yea, and alſo liveth ever to make requeſt or interceſſion with God for us, even for ſuch as come to God by him: And that in the vertues of his moſt perfect and acceptable Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that prevails and proſpers for whatſoever he asketh: As alſo, he ſhall come again in the power and glory of God, to raiſe and judge all, and give eternal life and an everlaſting Kingdom to all that obey him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Rom</hi> 8.34. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. &amp; 7.25. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.31.36. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.28.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:102366:140"/>4. That God of his great mercy, and in his goodneſs, hath called the now Believer to the faith of his Son, and brought him, in ſome meaſure, to know and believe on him, and ſo hath taken him into his houſe and family, to live upon his Son and his Grace in him: Hath delivered <hi>him from the power of darkneſs, and tranſlated him into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of his dear Son,</hi> Col. 1.12, 13. <hi>in whom there is the redemption</hi> forementioned, and ſuch fulneſs and ſufficiency to ſave him, and to perfect what concerns him, &amp; hath already ſo loved as to ſuffer for him, while a ſinner and enemy (as before.) And faithful is he that hath called, to do what yet is needful further to be done, for and in us, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.23, 24. we being through his death reconciled, how much more by his life ſhall we be ſaved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. being brought upon that foundation that is moſt holy, and that is laid ſtrong and ſure for the upholding and ſanctifying to God all that is built upon it, how ſhall he not for that founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſake, and by it, confer upon us his further grace and bleſſing, to prepare and fit us for his inhabiting us, and filling us with glory. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo,</p>
            <p n="5">5. That God now by vertue of this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, or holy faith, loves the Believer, owning him as his, imbraces him as his ſon, and is become a Father to him; and <hi>if God juſtifies, who is he that ſhall charge or condemn? If God be for us, who is he that it againſt us?</hi> That is conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in compariſon of him, Rom. 8.31 38. To which add,</p>

That he hath made many gracious and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes, in Chriſt, to the believer in him, abiding on that foundation, and building up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thereon and praying to him in the Holy Ghoſt; yea, promiſes for his adminiſtring grace to him for his abiding, ſtrengthning and building up; as that <hi>he will be with them, and bleſs them, never leave them nor forſake them:</hi> that <hi>he will be their God, and they ſhall be his people: He will be a Father to them, and they ſhall be his ſons and daughters;</hi> yea, godlines hath the promiſe of this life and that that is to come: for the performance whereof, both Chriſts Mediation with his Father, and the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes of God are engaged, both by his word and oath (in which <hi>two it is impoſſible for him to lye</hi>) in and through Chriſt are intereſted; and <hi>faithful is he that hath promiſed, who alſo will do it,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.23.

            <p n="2">2. This waiting implies further, a tarrying for the good hoped for, a patient abiding and ſtaying in the way to the enjoyment of what it expects: In which alſo two things are contained,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That God doth exerciſe the believer under a want, and with a delay of what mercy and good he hath provided for him, and promiſed to him. He doth not preſently poſſeſs the ſoul of all the good he intends it, nor preſently perform all that he hath promiſed. Though he gives what ever he ſees good and meet for its preſent caſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that method in which his wiſdom hath
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:102366:144"/>
ordered to lead it, yet the great things he hath prepard for it he doth not preſently confer. <hi>The viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> (the mercy diſcover'd &amp; promis'd in the Goſpel) <hi>is for an appointed time, but at the end it ſhall ſpeak and not lie or fail, though it tarry, wait for it</hi> (ſaith <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.3.) <hi>becauſe it will ſurely come,</hi> (viz. at the appointed time, beyond which) <hi>it will not tarry;</hi> but its for an appointed time, till which it will tarry and not come, or be accompliſhed. And this God doth,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To try and exerciſe the Believers faith to ſee and prove whether he doth believe in him or not; and to draw his faith out into exerciſe, while it grapples with delays, and non appearances to ſenſe and reaſon, that ſo it will be, as is ſaid to it. So <hi>the word of the Lord tried Joſeph,</hi> while it was not of a good time performed to him; yea, while it ſeemed improbable to the eye of fleſh and blood or carnal reaſon that ever it ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.19. So God exerciſed and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Abraham</hi>'s faith concerning a childe, making him wait 25 years after his coming into <hi>Canaan,</hi> before he performed the promiſe thereof to him; and ſo he tried <hi>David,</hi> as pertaining to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for thats an evidence of the Souls belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God and truſting in him, when it yet holds faſt its confidence, though he ſeems to forget his word, and makes no haſte to perform it to it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To try and exerciſe the love of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to God, and to the mercy promiſed, whether it will yet wait upon him, and ſtay for his promiſe or imbrace ſome other more preſent injoyment that is more at hand and in its power to attain; it men love not God, nor the mercy promiſed
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:102366:145"/>
at ſome high rate; they will let it go, and not ſtay or tarry for it, they will with <hi>Demas</hi> imbrace this preſent world; but if they love him and his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, they will wait and tarry for it, how ever long it be that he delay it, as <hi>Jacob</hi> that loved <hi>Rachel,</hi> was willing to wait and tarry for her ſeven years, rather than not enjoy her, and counted it <hi>but a ſmall time for the love he had to her,</hi> Gen. 29.20.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To draw out the deſire and affection of the Soul more after him and his mercy that it might long for it, and pray and be earneſt with God for it, that ſo it might not come before it be heartily welcome and acceptable to the Soul, that ſo alſo the Soul may be more thankful for mercy, and better prizes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> uſe it when it comes; what men come eaſily and ſuddenly by they often as little value or regard, but what they long for and earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly deſire and ſeek after, and yet do not preſently finde, that they more prize when they doe obtain: <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> being long delayed before they obtained a childe; when at length God gave one to them, they called him <hi>Iſaac,</hi> becauſe of the joy and laughter that then they had in him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.6. And <hi>Hannah</hi> having obtained a Son af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter long ſeeking and waiting, dedicated him to God in thankfulneſs to him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. and 2.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To humble and meeken them in their hearts and ſpirits, that ſo they might not lift up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the mercy injoyed, as if they had it, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by themſelves, or for ſome worthineſs in themſelves; but know that they receive it of the Grace of God in his time and at his pleaſure, that ſo he might therein, and therefore be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:102366:145"/>
Should God give men favours and mercies ſo ſoon as they deſire them, they might be apt to be lifted up in and for them, as if their worthineſs was ſuch, that God gave them with reſpect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; or as if their deſires did fetch them down, and ſo after a ſort by their power they had obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, but when God withholds his mercies for ſome time, he gives his people in that time to ſee and prove the many weakneſſes of their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and the many diſtempers and froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in their hearts, the murmurings and faintings that they are apt to fall into, and how ſoon they are apt to tire and be weary, if God did not in mercy pardon and quicken them, by which means they prove that it is not for their own wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs that they are at laſt ſupplied &amp; ſatisfied, but out of the great goodneſs of God toward them. Or alſo that it is not by the power of their endeavors or deſires, but by the power and good will of God that they are ſaved. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> tells <hi>Iſrael</hi> from God that he had <hi>led them forty years in the wilderneſs to humble them and prove them, that he might do them good in the later end,</hi> that they might not attribute the Lords giving them the good land to their worthineſs, but to his goodneſs, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.2.3.16. and in Chapter 9. minds them of their many failings and great iniquities committed by them in that time of tryal, that ſo they might not ſay when brought into the Land of <hi>Canaan, that for their righteouſneſs he had brought them into that Land.</hi> Yea, he goeth over it twice or thrice, that <hi>not for their righteouſneſs, or the uprightneſs of their hearts they did go in to poſſeſs that Land, but for the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:102366:146" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wickedneſs of that people God drave them out, and to perform his words ſworn to their Fathers,</hi> &amp;c. which he demonſtrates from the many proofs of their ſtubborneſs which they had given in that time of exerciſe and trial ordered to them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 9.4, 5, 6, 7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. In a word, God doth thus to prepare his people for mercies, and make them more meet and fit for the injoyment of them, and more thankful for them while they ſee they are at his pleaſure, and in fitteſt time beſtowed on them, that <hi>patience having its perfect work in them, they might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, wanting no good thing,</hi> James 1.3, 4. for,</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is alſo in this tarrying a patient bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that delay, or deferring of comforts, and a ſtill retaining their confidence that they ſhall be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and a keeping the way in which they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to expect them; even as he that waits for a man, both goeth to the place in which he hath promiſed to meet with him, and in the time of his not coming ſtays there for him till he come: not turning and going again though at his firſt coming and for ſome time after he there finds him not; yea, and though he ſuſtain ſome troubles by ſo ſtaying. <hi>He that believes makes not haſte,</hi> Iſa. 25.16. <hi>He caſts not away his confidence</hi> as they that <hi>draw back to perdition,</hi> but exerciſes <hi>patience till he have done the will of God therein;</hi> and ſo <hi>through faith and patience inherits the promiſes,</hi> Heb. 6.12. with 10.35, 36, 37, 38. and both thoſe things are joyned together in the Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as anſwering to waiting for the Lord, <hi>Lam.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. An earneſt deſire and ſeeking after the mercy and ſalvation of God, as from that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference now mentioned as the conſequent from the aſſertion of Gods goodneſs to the ſoul that ſeeks him is implied. And indeed the heart cannot tarry and wait in hope and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of any thing that it hath no deſire to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy or ſee. However the outward man might be forced and conſtrainedly made to ſtay in a place till ſuch a thing come, yet the heart is gone from it in caſe it hath no deſire after it. An earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire then for, and a ſeeking after this mercy and Grace of God is here alſo commended to us in this waiting poſture exhorted to, that our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhould be after and upon that eternal life in Chriſt, and that mercy of Chriſt that is needful to bring us thereunto: and ſo that we be not ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful nor take up content and ſatisfaction in what's already attained, as if we had enough and needed no more, <hi>Laodicea</hi>-like: but with our Souls be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring after God, and with our very ſpirits longing for him till he ſatisfie our ſouls with his goodneſs, as was <hi>Davids</hi> poſture of waiting for God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.5, 6.

watching for what is waited for; yea, a moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and deſirous watching, ſuch as that is of thoſe that being benighted and bewildred for want of light, do long for the morning light. And indeed ſuch a waiting for Gods mercy becomes thoſe that are building up themſelves on their moſt holy faith, and praying in the holy Ghoſt: for men may pray formally, or put their life and Religion in ſaying over prayers, and yet have their hearts dead and void of any living deſires of Gods preſence and favour; but the praying in the Holy Ghoſt cannot ſtand without it, as may appear in what we have ſaid thereabout; yea, this waiting may have in it further:</p>
            <p n="4">4. A waiting upon God in Chriſt as well as a waiting for him, or for ſomething from him; a patient attending to him and following after him whitherſoever he goes, and to be ordered and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by him in what ever he requires; as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 123.1, 2. <hi>

            <p n="2">2. Now the Object to be waited for, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed to be <hi>the Mercy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt unto Eternal life.</hi> Eternal life is the end but neceſſary thereto, as the way to bring us to it is the Mercy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

And where he ſhews not mercy, neither doth God the Father ſhew mercy; nor can the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and mercy of men, be they never ſo great or mighty or many, advantage a man, any thing in compariſon hereof; the Sovereign power of life and death, yea, of everlaſting life or death being in and with him. So that whom he ſaves and bleſſes, they are and ſhall be ſaved and bleſſed; and whom he deſtroys or rejects from his mercy they ſhall periſh everlaſtingly, for his judgment is true and righteous and takes place and ſtands faſt for ever. His Mercy therefore is worthy the waiting for, and moſt earneſtly to be ſought after, as without which there is no ſalvation or happineſs injoyable by us, and as that which is the fountain &amp; well-ſpring of all bleſſing and happineſs. But here let us view,</p>
            <p n="1">1. What is meant by this Mercy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What that phraſe or term of Mercy to be waited for, ſignifies and hints to us.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:102366:149"/>1. To the firſt. Mercy is either an <hi>affect</hi> in the heart, or,</p>
            <p>An <hi>effect</hi> in its work: to take in both of them.</p>
            <p>Mercy is properly an affection or frame of heart, in which it pities and compaſſionates anothers mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and affliction, leading to ſpare one where there is power to harm him, and to ſuccour him in neceſſities and indigencies, where there is power to help him.</p>
            <p>And this is attributed to God and Chriſt that he is merciful and full of compaſſion, ready to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give offences and relieve in wants and miſeries, and do what is good for the Creatures deliverance from evils, and conferring ſafety and happineſs, as may be abundantly ſeen in the Scriptures, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.8. <hi>The Lord is merciful and gracious, ſlow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.</hi> Yea, this his Name, <hi>The Lord, Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-ſuffering, abundant in goodneſs and truth, keeping mercy for thouſands,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6, 7. And ſo it is ſaid of Chriſt, that he is a <hi>merciful and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful High-Prieſt,</hi> in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.16, 17. And indeed God and Chriſt have abundantly manifeſted their merciful heart toward poor ſinful afflicted Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures many ways. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. God hath manifeſted himſelf merciful:</p>
            <p n="1">1. In taking pity on mankinde when fallen from him into a ſtate of exceeding great ſin and miſery, in that he did not then caſt him off and deſtroy him: but on the contrary deviſed a way and means for his redemption and recovery; yea, ſuch a way of recovery as the tranſlating our ſin and miſery upon his own onely begotten Son, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing &amp; in due time ſending him forth into the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:102366:149"/>
world to be the propitiation for our ſins, bearing them on his own body on the tree, that through his ſtripes we might be healed, both abaſing him thereto, and exalting him to the height of Glory and Majeſty, therethrough at his own right hand, that he might by the vertues of the former, and in the exerciſe of the latter upon that account bring us back again to God. Herein he hath ſhewed himſelf loving and merciful to us beyond all queſtion or expreſſion; as it is ſaid, <hi>Through the tender mercy of our God, the day ſpring</hi> (Chriſt the bright and the Morning-Star) <hi>from on high hath viſited us,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.78.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God hath alſo manifeſted himſelf merciful to us in <hi>freely juſtifying us</hi> (mankinde) by his Grace, through <hi>the redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt, not imputing to the world their treſpaſſes,</hi> but preaching peace to us by him, and through his blood, and opening his Kingdom for us and to us, with gracious calls and counſels and invitations to enter thereinto, and be made partakers of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed priviledges thereof unto everlaſting life, and in freely admitting and accepting all that obey his calls and counſels therein, however otherwiſe and formerly ſinful and unworthy, as may be ſeen in <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> the Publicans, harlots, and prodigals whom upon their coming to him, he hath freely pardoned and accepted and made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his righteouſneſs and bleſſing, as if they never had been ſo vile and wretched, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23, 24. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19, 20, 21. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.15, 17. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.4, 8, 9. and 9.12 13, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.37, 47. &amp; 15.1, 2, 15 16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6, 9, 10, 11.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:102366:150"/>3. God hath ſhewed himſelf merciful to us Gentiles and Heathens, in calling us ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to the knowledg of his Son, and of his Grace in him, when as formerly we were ſo groſs and grievous ſinners againſt all former diſpenſations of his goodneſs and manifeſtations of himſelf in his works and providences. It was his great mercy through the blood of his Son to make peace and atonement for us, blotting out all former treſpaſſes &amp; admitting us to fellowſhip with the Saints, and ſo with himſelf through Chriſt Jeſus, as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.4, 5, 11, 12, 17, 19, 20. as it is ſaid, <hi>that the Gentiles might glorifie God for his Mercy,</hi> Rom. 15 9. and <hi>who had not in times paſt obtained mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but now have obtained mercy,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.10. whence, <hi>I beſeech you by the Mercies of God, offer up your body a living Sacrifice,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. and the like he will ſhew forth to the Jews in calling them again, and receiving them to favour after all their unbelief and ſtubborneſſes againſt him, as it is ſaid, <hi>He hath ſhut them all up in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, that he might have mercy upon them all,</hi> Rom. 11.32.</p>
            <p n="4">4.

            <p n="2">2. So alſo Chriſt hath abundantly ſhewed forth his mercy toward us:</p>
            <p n="1">1. In that being in the form of God, not thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it robbery to be equal with God, yet for our ſakes, at the will and appointment of the Father, he abaſed himſelf, laid aſide his Glory, humbled himſelf to the Death, the Death of the Croſs, and therein bare our ſins in his own body on the tree, and was made a curſe for us to redeem us from ſin and curſe, that ſo he might in the vertues of his ſufferings and Sacrifice bring us back again to God. <hi>Ye know</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9.) <hi>the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt that he being rich became poor, that we through his poverty might be made rich.</hi> He is merciful, full of compaſſion, and gracious, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.8.</p>

And indeed the mercy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt to be waited for by believers, is not ſimply an affection of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in him towards us, but his evidencing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrating that his affection of mercy in the acts and exerciſes of it, but not in giving himſelf a ranſome for us, and dying for us for that is paſt, and to be believed by us, as a thing done and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed already and as the bottom, ground and foundation of all expectation of further mercy, nor will he die any more; but it is for ſome acts or exerciſes of mercy for the future in the exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of thoſe glorious Offices which his Father hath deſigned him to at and from his right hand: as to ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. His paſſing by and pardoning our ſins for his Names ſake, hiding, covering, and keeping them, as it were from the eye of God; ſo as that he mark them not againſt us, to judge and puniſh us according to them; as it is ſaid, <hi>If thou, Lord, ſhouldeſt mark iniquity who ſhould ſtand, but there is forgiveneſs with thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 130.4. which <hi>ver.</hi> 6.7. is called <hi>Mercy.</hi> And <hi>who is a God like
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:102366:151"/>
unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity and paſſeth by the tranſgreſſions of the remnant of his heritage; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth not his anger for ever, becauſe he delighteth in mercy,</hi> Mic. 7.18. And ſure this is one main thing, in which he is evidenced to be a merciful High Prieſt, in that <hi>he maketh reconciliation for the ſins of the people, and is the ſtanding propitiation for our ſins,</hi> that we might receive forgiveneſs of them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17. with 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.2. So <hi>Paul ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained mercy,</hi> that is, <hi>the forgiveneſs of his ſins,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13, 16. that's mercy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His ſympathizing with us, and ſuccouring us in temptations, afflictions, and ſufferings, as is alſo aſſerted, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.18. and 4.15, 16. <hi>In that he ſuffered being tempted, he is able</hi> (fit and meet) <hi>to ſuccour thoſe alſo that are tempted. For we have not ſuch an High Prieſt as cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted even as we, yet without ſin. Let us therefore goe boldly to the Throne of Grace that we may obtain</hi> (or take as it were at his hands) <hi>mercy, and finde Grace to help us in a time of need.</hi> Whereas it is evident that mercy ſignifies ſomething tranſient, (or paſſing) from Chriſt to men, and not onely a thing abiding in the heart of Chriſt, ſo what ſhould that be there but the fruits of his ſympathizing with us in our infirmities and temptations obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for us by his interceſſion for us, as our High Prieſt; namely, ſuccour in our needs, ſupport in our ſorrows and ſufferings, and ſeaſonable iſſues out of them? even as the relieving the poor and afflicted in their poverty and ſtraits, is called the ſhewing mercy to the poor, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 109.12, 16. <hi>Prov.</hi> 14 21, 31. and Gods ſparing <hi>Lots</hi> life and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:102366:152"/>
helping or haſting him out of <hi>Sodom, Gen.</hi> 19.16. to that purpoſe was an evidence of his <hi>being mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. His beſtowing any benefit, favour, or bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon us, may be called his ſhewing us mercy, and the ſaid benefit or bleſſing beſtowed may be called his mercy; as all the good God did to and beſtowed on <hi>David</hi> is called <hi>his ſhewing him great mercy or kindneſs,</hi> 1 King. 3.6. and in that ſenſe he is ſaid, <hi>to ſatisfie,</hi> as well as to ſave <hi>with his mercy,</hi> and <hi>to crown with loving kindnes and tender mercies,</hi> Pſal. 90.19. and 103.4. and <hi>the earth</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>full of the mercy of the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 119.64. and ſo the Lord Jeſus himſelf and all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits and bleſſings in him are called, the <hi>ſure mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of David,</hi> Iſa. 55.3. with <hi>Act.</hi> 13.34. and in that ſenſe all the kindneſs, favour, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing diſpenſed to us by Jeſus Chriſt both for ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying and ſaving the Soul, and for ſupplying the outward man may be called his Mercy, and may well be underſtood to be compriſed and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified in this expreſſion, <hi>The Mercy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in as much as it is all the fruit and effect of his mercy and pity towards us, and hath in it an abundant relief of our miſeries: Yea, and,</p>
            <p n="4">4. His glorious coming again to raiſe the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver out of the duſt, and to put an end to all the ſorrows, ſufferings, and abaſement of his poor Church and people, may well be called the mercy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe an act of his mercy toward them, in pitying their miſeries and ſufferings, and fully redeeming them out of them all into the injoyment of the Glory prepared for
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:102366:152"/>
them. Which alſo may the rather be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to be principally and ultimately here meant, becauſe the following words <hi>(unto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life)</hi> will beſt agree with it as the immediate iſſue and conſequent thereof: for that properly may be called the mercy of our Lord Jeſus unto eternal life, which is an act of his mercy, freeing them from all that keeps them out of eternal life, and brings them to the actual and perfect injoyment of eternal life; though the exerciſe of his Mercy in all the three former, as neceſſary to the fitting them for eternal life, and keeping them, to it may alſo be very well inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as that which the Believer is alſo to wait for, but principally his coming again, and the mercy thereof, as the furtheſt and main of all; called therefore <hi>the bleſſed hope,</hi> Tit. 2.13. Now,</p>
            <p n="2">2. This phraſe of the Mercy of our Lord implies ſomething both with reference,

            <p n="2">2. In reſpect of our defects, wants and ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of attainments to the full poſſeſſion of the bleſſing and glory of God, as mercy ſignifies kindneſs, or a gift of good for our ſupplies as we have need; for the Believer, though com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat in Chriſt his head and root, yet is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and perfect in his receipt of him, and the grace in him; hath <hi>not yet attained, neither is yet perfect,</hi> Phil. 3.13, 14. ſees but in part, and knows but in part yet, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11.12. hath but the firſt fruits of mercy and bleſſing, not the full harveſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23.

               </gap> is very obvious to ſenſe; for we ſee the beſt of men, are men ſtill ſubject to like paſſions, infirmities, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and ailments as others. <hi>Job,</hi> though a perfect man, yet ſorely tried both in body and ſpirit with ſad afflictions: the Prophets and Apoſtles examples of patience, and ſuffering ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities of divers ſorts and natures, under which they have not had ability of themſelves to ſtand, but as God by his mercy in Chriſt gave them ſtrength and relief, remembring his mercy, in the midſt of his judgements. Nay, in the day of the Lord, the righteous ſervants of God ſhall need <hi>his mercy,</hi> for the blotting out perfectly all their tranſgreſſions, and deliverance of them from all wrath and judgement, into the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his everlaſting Kingdom; as it was therefore <hi>Pauls</hi> prayer for <hi>Oneſiphorus</hi> and his houſe, in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.18. <hi>The Lord grant to him that he may find mercy in that day:</hi> Though he had done very many good deeds for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, eſpecially in caſe of ſwe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

aſide in ſome things from him, as may ſeem to have been his caſe, or the caſe of his houſhold, in that that prayer for his houſhold and him fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low immediately, upon the mention of the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of all thoſe in <hi>Aſia</hi> from <hi>Paul,</hi> v. 15. Again, it's here implied in the word, <hi>Mercy:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Believers, however diligent in ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rving God, and edifying themſelves on the faith of Chriſt, deſerve not the love of God, or the enjoyment of his preſence and bleſſing with them unto everlaſting life, nay, nor any ſupply to their want<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> or needs in any thing: It's of mercy, not of merit, that God doth own them, and that Chriſt takes care of them, and helps and bleſſes them: They cannot challenge it as matter of due debt, but need to beg (even their daily bread too) as matter of mercy; or as the effect and fruit of the mercy of Jeſus Chriſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, in his Sufferings and Sacrifice of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up for them And this indeed ſprings from the former, their weakneſs to do any thing for God, becoming him or his engagements upon us; and their ſinfulneſs, defiling all their beſt doings. They have neither power nor purity enough in themſelves, to do ſuch ſervice for him as may bind him by way of deſert to them: If he ſhould mark the iniquities of their holy things, they could none of them ſtand, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 130.3, 4. Therefore good <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> when he had made mention of many good deeds wel done by him, adds, <hi>Remember me O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the houſe of my God, &amp; for the offices there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,</hi>

Neh. 13.14. and after further mention of his zeal for the Sabbath, he adds again, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. <hi>Remember me, O my God, concerning this alſo, and ſpare me according to the greatneſs of thy mercy:</hi> as implying, that his good deeds, though very exemplary, were ſo far from meriting reward from God, or the love and bleſſing of God, that it was his mercy to ſpare him from his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not to blot out all he had done out of his remembrance. Though God doth give reward to him that willeth that that is good, &amp; that runneth the way of his Commandments, yet that rewarding of them is <hi>not of him that willeth, or of him that runneth</hi> (as the due de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert of his willing and running, and what he may challenge as debt) <hi>but of him that ſhews mercy</hi> in pardoning the defects of both <hi>willing</hi> and <hi>running,</hi> and accepting them and him in whom they are, through Jeſus Chriſt. So that <hi>no fleſh hath any thing to glory of in the preſence of God,</hi> for any thing found in, as of it, or done by it: But there is cauſe of abaſement and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility for the beſt; no cauſe or ground for pride and high-mindedneſs in any. Chriſt <hi>brings up the top ſtone with ſhouting, and crying, Grace, grace unto it,</hi> Zech. 4.6, 7. This is implied too in the word <hi>Mercy,</hi> as to be waited for by the believer in all his building up himſelf on his moſt holy Faith.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But then the conſideration of him, whoſe mercy it is, that we are to wait for, ſignified in this, that it is called the mercy of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, doth afford great encouragement to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:102366:155"/>
expect and hope for it, as well as engagement to wait for it. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In that he is the Lord that engages us to wait for it, it being meet to wait on one ſo great; And if we conſider how and upon what account he is the Lord, in the nature of man, that will encourage to expect his mercy, and ſo to wait in hope of it: For it was by his mercy already te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified to us, towards us ſinners, while ſo, in that he then abaſed himſelf and became man for us, and as man ſuffered to the death, the death of the croſs for us: that he was in the ſame nature of man exalted and glorified to be Lord of all, both things and perſons, as was above noted, <hi>Acts</hi> 2 36. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2 9, 10, 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9. <hi>Becauſe he humbled himſelf to the death, the death of the croſs, therefore God hath highly exalted him, and given him a name above every name, that at the name of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and that every tongue ſhould confeſs that Jeſus is the Lord, to the glory of God,</hi> &amp;c. Now if he had ſuch mercy for us, as to purchaſe to himſelf in the nature of man, a Lordſhip over us, by ranſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us from death by his death for us, how ſhall we not think, that being for that his love to us, and ſervice for us, made Lord, he will exerciſe his Lordſhip in a way of grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy toward us, when brought to own him for out Lord, and to ſubject our ſelves to his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over us (as in believing on him we do) and eſpecially, if we therein exerciſe our ſelves to more knowledge of him, and obedience to him, as in building up our ſelves on our moſt

Holy ſaith? <hi>If juſtified by his Blood, much more will be ſave us from wrath in his Mercy towards us,</hi> Rom. 5.9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And yet more in that he is our Lord; as the Lord of all generally in a more common ſenſe and relation ſo the believers Lord in a ſpecial ſenſe and relation, as exerciſing his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip peculiarly over and for them, as one owned as their Lord, and depended on for the exerciſe of his power for their help, yea, he is ſo the Lord of the Believers as the Husband is Lord of his wife, as he is often ſtiled in the Scripture lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.10. <hi>Hearken O Daughter, and conſider, incline thine eare alſo and hear, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get alſo thine own people and thy Fathers houſe, ſo ſhall the King greatly deſire thy beauty, for he is thy Lord, and worſhip thou him.</hi> And ſurely he that is, ſpecially the Lord, owner, Head, Husband, and diſpoſer of his people, is both worthy to be waited on by them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
